Top 5:  ['Is it possible to support PPPOE accreditation on the LAN side of a Balance?\nWe have a ISP that would like to use a Balance in their core network but need to be able to support PPPOE on the LAN side of the Balance for each end user to gain service.\nWould this be possible?\nI know that there is already PPPOE on the WAN of the Peplink to connect to the internet, we now want it on the LAN as well please!\nThis is interesting but can you tell us more why putting a Balance One in a ‚Äúcore network‚Äù? How many PPPOE end users connections are expected to terminate on each Balance One? And why choosing a Balance One for this purpose?\nI didn‚Äôt actually mention Balance ONE but that is what they are using now for some end users and they are familiar with them.\nWe would be recommending one of the bigger units for the core network!\nI believe it will be 5-10 users per Balance and they would like to have speed controls linked to each PPPOE account.\nMy bad. For some reason I keep reading Balance One in my mind.\nBut why having a Balance as PPPOE server? And in this case, I think multi-WAN features are not used, correct?\nWe have got another situation where PPPOE accounts on the LAN will be useful.\nThere are two ways of implementing the load balancing part. 1) clients get balanced between WANS (all traffic from one client goes down a single WAN) and if that WAN fails, they get disconnected and reconnect automatically on another WAN. 2) Clents connect to Balance and then all traffic from Balance is SpeedFusioned back to a data centre where each client has a public IP address. (PPPOE could be done on the Balance or at data centre)'
 'Tati Westbrook Has Put Her Mansion On The Market Just 3 Months After Buying It\nJust four months after buying her home in Los Angeles, the beauty YouTuber has already put it back on the market, reports real estate publication, Dirt. While back then, Tati picked it up for USD $3.3 million (AUD $4.6 million), she‚Äôs now looking to sell it for USD $4 million (AUD $5.6 million), making her a cool $1 million profit.\nThe mansion in LA suburb Sherman Oaks, which has served as the backdrop in hundreds of her YouTube videos, features a butler‚Äôs pantry and wine closet, a plunge pool with raised spa and... an on-site YouTube studio. Handy!\nEven though she bought it just four months ago, YouTuber Tati Westbrook has flipped her Encino home back on the market with a $4 million price tag. Having bought it for $3.3 million, Westbrook stands to rake in a nice profit from the sale. Though they just recently purchased it, the beauty influencer and her hubby have been renting the property for nearly four years and even hired the YouTube-famous design duo Mr. Kate to give their guesthouse a complete makeover üíÑ\nIt‚Äôs also got a built-in cinema, five bedrooms and a total of seven bathrooms. By far the house‚Äôs pi√®ce de r√©sistance, however, would be its ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù (or so says the listing) master suite, which comes complete with a fireplace, spa-style bathroom, massive tub and brass chandeliers. Lovely.\nDedicated fans wouldn‚Äôt be all that surprised by this news. In December, Tati Westbrook told her Instagram fans she was looking to relocate from LA to her hometown of Seattle. Since then, viewers have noticed all of her recent clips have been shot in Washington state.\nThe sale comes just two months after fellow beauty YouTuber Jeffree Star put his own mansion up for sale. Interestingly, Jeffree didn‚Äôt seem to be looking to make a profit. Though he‚Äôd bought the place for USD $3.62 million four years before and had done made countless renovations, the Jeffree Star Cosmetics CEO was only looking to sell the property for $3.6 million.\nYouTuber and cosmetics mogul Jeffree Star is officially waving goodbye to his "Barbie dreamhouse" Calabasas mansion. With interiors painted an almost unsettling shade of Pepto Bismol pink, Star\'s 6,700-square-foot former home is currently listed at a little over $3.5 million. Surprisingly, listing photos don\'t include pics of the perhaps the most interesting part of the house ‚Äî the custom bank vault that Star spent hundreds of thousands of dollars installing that housed his collection of designer goods. More deets and pics of the Star\'s former home in the link in our bio üíÖ\nBut back to Tati, and her reason for selling. To be honest, we don\'t blame her for wanting to leave LA, home to most of the big-name beauty YouTuber stars.\nGiven everything that\'s gone down with her, Jeffree Star, James Charles and Shane Dawson, we can see why she\'d be wanting some space. And probably just a fresh start in a new state, really.

 'Brass fittings are a type of plumbing fixture that is made out of brass, a type of metal. Brass fittings are used to connect two pieces of plumbing together. There are many different types of brass fittings, including brass couplings, elbows, brass tees, and caps.\nBrass fittings are often used in water systems because brass is a corrosion-resistant metal. This means that it does not rust or corrode over time, which can cause leaks in plumbing systems. Brass fittings are also relatively easy to solder, which makes them a popular choice for connecting metal pipes together.\nWhat Are Brass Fittings Used For?\nBrass fittings are essential to the plumbing system and can be found in every home. Brass fittings have a number of different uses, from on/off valves, water supply lines, drain pipes, water pump connections, relief valves for pressure reduction, and more. With so many types of brass fittings being used for so many purposes, we thought it was time to write up this blog with all the information you need about brass fittings.\nWhat Are Brass Fittings Used For?\nBrass fittings come in a variety of sizes and shapes and are typically made out of metal or plastic, but some may also include rubber components as well. The purpose behind using these parts is to join two pieces together while providing space for an object such as a screw or bolt.\nThe most popular brass fittings are elbows, tees, and nipples. Elbows are used to change the direction of the pipe, while tees are used to create a three-way junction. Nipples are short lengths of pipes that have threaded ends that can be screwed into fittings on both sides.\nEach type of brass fitting serves a different function in the plumbing system. In this blog, we will specifically be talking about the uses of brass fittings in plumbing systems.\n- On/Off Valves: An on/off valve is a brass fitting that is used to turn the water flow on and off. This fitting is often found near the water meter or at the entrance of the house where the main water line enters. It is important to have an on/off valve in these locations to be able to easily shut off the water when needed.\n- Water Supply Lines: A water supply line is a brass fitting that transports potable water from the main water source to the various fixtures in the home, such as sinks, toilets, and bathtubs. These lines are typically made out of copper but can also be made out of plastic or brass. The fittings used for connecting these lines together are called couplings, unions, and brass adapters.\n- Drain Pipes: A drain pipe is a plumbing fixture that is used to remove wastewater from the home. This wastewater is often discharged into a sewer or septic system. The drain pipe itself is typically made out of plastic, but the fittings that connect it to the other plumbing fixtures are often made out of brass.\n- Water Pump Connections: A water pump is a device that is used to move water from one location to another. This pump is often found in the basement or crawlspace of a home and is used to supply water to the upper floors. The connections between the water pump and the other plumbing fixtures are typically made out of brass.\n- Relief Valves for Pressure Reduction: A relief valve is a brass fitting that is used to relieve pressure in the plumbing system. This valve is often found on hot water tanks, boilers, and dishwashers. When the pressure in the system gets too high, the relief valve will open and release water to reduce the pressure.\nBrass fittings are an essential part of the plumbing system and have a variety of different uses. These fittings are used to connect various types of pipes and fixtures together. They are also used to regulate the flow of water and to relieve pressure in the system. With so many different uses for brass fittings, it is important to know which type of fitting is needed for each specific application.\nWhat Are Types of Brass Fittings?\nBrass is an incredibly popular material for plumbing fittings. That‚Äôs because brass is not only strong and durable, but it also has a natural resistance to corrosion. This makes it ideal for use in water-based applications, where it will be exposed to moisture on a regular basis.\nThere are a number of different types of brass fittings available on the market, each of which has its own specific purpose. In this blog post, we‚Äôre going to take a closer look at some of the most common types of brass fittings so that you can choose the right ones for your needs.\n- Compression Fittings\nBrass compression fittings are one of the most widely used types of brass fittings. They are incredibly easy to install, and they can be used with a variety of different materials, including copper, PVC, and CPVC.\nCompression brass fittings consist of two elements: a compression nut and a compression ring. The compression nut is threaded onto the end of the pipe, and the compression ring is placed over the end of the pipe and screwed down tight. This creates a seal that prevents water from leaking out.\n- Tee Fittings\nBrass tee fittings are used to connect three pieces of plumbing together. They are available in both threaded and welded varieties, and they come in a range of different sizes.\n- Elbow Fittings\nElbow fittings allow you to change the direction of your plumbing. They are available in both 90-degree and 45-degree varieties, and they come in a range of different sizes.\n- Cross Fittings\nCross fittings are very similar to brass tee fittings, except that they have four openings instead of three. They are used to connect four pieces of plumbing together, and they come in a range of different sizes.\n- Coupling Fittings\nBrass couplings are used to connect two pieces of plumbing together. They come in a range of different sizes, and they can be either threaded or welded.\n- Cap Fittings\nCap fittings are used to seal the end of a piece of plumbing. They come in a range of different sizes, and they can be either threaded or welded.\n- Plug Fittings\nBrass plug fittings are very similar to cap fittings, except that they have a male thread instead of a female thread. This allows them to be connected to a piece of plumbing with a female thread. They also come in a range of different sizes.\n- Nipple Fittings\nNipple fittings are short lengths of pipe with male threads on both ends. They are used to connect two pieces of plumbing together, and they come in a range of different sizes.\n- Union Fittings\nBrass unions are to connect two pieces of plumbing together. They come in a range of different sizes, and they have a female thread on one end and a male thread on the other.\n- Valve Fittings\nValve fittings are used to control the flow of water through a piece of plumbing. They come in a range of different sizes and types, including ball valves, gate valves, and check valves.\nNow that you know more about the different types of brass fittings available, you can choose the right ones for your needs. If you‚Äôre not sure which ones to use, or if you need help with installation, be sure to contact a professional plumber for assistance.\nBenefits of Brass Fittings in Plumbing\nBrass fittings have been a staple in plumbing since the 1700s. Here are just a few of the benefits they offer:\n- Brass is durable and long-lasting. It won‚Äôt corrode or rust like some other materials, making it a reliable choice for plumbing applications.\n- Brass is also resistant to bacteria and other contaminants, making it a safer option for potable water systems.\n- Brass fittings are easy to install and use, and they can be adapted to fit most plumbing applications.\n- Brass is a relatively affordable material, making it an economical choice for plumbing systems.\n- Most importantly, brass fittings are known for their high quality and reliability. When installed properly, they will provide years of trouble-free service.\nIn addition to their use in plumbing, brass fittings can also be used in other applications. For example, brass fittings are often used in HVAC systems to connect ductwork together. They are also used in electrical applications, where they are used to connect wires and cables together. Brass fittings are strong and durable and can be used in a variety of applications.\nThey are a popular choice among plumbers due to their strength and reliability. If you need to connect pipes or tubing together, brass fittings are the perfect option. Tubomart is one of the leading manufacturers of brass fittings you will find in the market today.

 '- How many minutes does a 700mb CD hold?\n- Why do CDs only hold 80 minutes?\n- Can you add more songs to a burned CD R?\n- How do I burn songs onto a CD?\n- Will CDs last forever?\n- Can you fix scratched CDs?\n- How can I burn more than 80 minutes on a CD?\n- How many tracks can you put on a CD?\n- How do I burn more songs on a CD?\n- What is the highest quality of music?\n- Are there CDs longer than 80 minutes?\n- What is the longest recordable CD?\n- Can you burn music to a DVD?\n- What should I do with old CDs?\n- Can you wear out a CD?\n- Is it better to burn a CD fast or slow?\n- How do I burn a high quality CD?\n- What is the best CD burner software for free?\nHow many minutes does a 700mb CD hold?\nIn most cases a 700MB CD-R will accommodate up to 80min of audio.\n74 minutes is the original Red Book spec (corresponding to 650MB CD-Rs).\nCommercial CDs have been exceeding that for a long time (in a few exceptional cases slightly over 80min)..\nWhy do CDs only hold 80 minutes?\nAudio CDs are not the same thing as data CDs, and they do not contain MP3 files. An audio CD contains audio data in CDDA (Compact Disc Digital Audio) format. ‚Ä¶ A minute of CDDA audio always takes up the same amount of space on the disc, which is why you can only burn a maximum number of minutes to a disc.\nCan you add more songs to a burned CD R?\nBurn additional files to CD-R If the disc is not closed, additional files can be added. When you are ready, place the CD-R into the optical drive, open the CD-R folder, add more files, and then select the Burn to disc option. ‚Ä¶ There is no Burn to disc option to click.\nHow do I burn songs onto a CD?\nTip 1: Burn An Audio CD with Windows Media PlayerStep 1: Insert a blank CD or DVD into your CD/ DVD drive. ‚Ä¶ Step 2: Open Windows Media Player and click on the ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù tab located in the right pane. ‚Ä¶ Step 3: Find the files you want to burn from your Library (Music, Videos, and Pictures) and drag them to the burn list.More items‚Ä¶\nWill CDs last forever?\nAmong the manufacturers that have done testing, there is consensus that, under recommended storage conditions, CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R discs should have a life expectancy of 100 to 200 years or more; CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM discs should have a life expectancy of 25 years or more.\nCan you fix scratched CDs?\nFix a Scratched Disc With Wax Incredibly, scratches in the surface of a CD or DVD can be fixed with softened wax! As with the toothpaste fix, you can use shoe polish, lip balm, furniture wax, or even petroleum jelly. Again, rub it into the surface of the disc to fill the scratch.\nHow can I burn more than 80 minutes on a CD?\nLuckily, there is a way to fit a lot more music onto a standard CD than normal‚Äîburn them to an ‚ÄúMP3‚Äù CD. Now, instead of only 80 minutes worth of music you can fit 800MB worth of MP3 files on one CD. Insert a blank CD in your computer‚Äôs CD burner.\nHow many tracks can you put on a CD?\n100 songsA data CD can hold 100 songs. CDs can help transfer files between computers. A blank CD can typically hold about 74 to 80 minutes of music, which is generally not enough to hold 100 songs.\nHow do I burn more songs on a CD?\nHow to Put 200 Songs on One CDClick ‚ÄúStart,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll Programs‚Äù and open Windows Media Player.Click ‚ÄúBurn.‚ÄùSelect ‚ÄúData CD or DVD.‚Äù Drag all 200 of your songs into the window on screen.Put your blank CD-R or CD-RW into your burner.Click ‚ÄúStart Burn‚Äù to burn your 200 songs to your CD.\nWhat is the highest quality of music?\nThe highest quality MP3 has a bitrate of 320kbps, whereas a 24-bit/192kHz file has a data rate of 9216kbps. Music CDs are 1411kbps. The hi-res 24-bit/96kHz or 24-bit/192kHz files should, therefore, more closely replicate the sound quality the musicians and engineers were working with in the studio.\nAre there CDs longer than 80 minutes?\nThe ‚ÄúRedbook‚Äù CD specifications state that CDs contain a maximum of 74 or 80 minutes of music. But over the years, record producers have tried to push that limit.\nWhat is the longest recordable CD?\nLargest Capacity The largest CD-R discs manufactured are 99-minute CD-R discs. For storage, these discs are capable of holding up to 870 MB of data.\nCan you burn music to a DVD?\nA DVD is physically different than a CD, so it will not play in a CD player. While a DVD-audio format exists, very few players will play it, especially in cars. So forget DVDs. A better solution is to convert the audio into MP3 format and burn the MP3 files on to a CD-R formatted as a DATA CD.\nWhat should I do with old CDs?\nGoodwill still sells CDs and DVDs and collects them at its drop-off locations. Many libraries also take them and will either stock them for checkout or sell them at sales or their used stores.\nCan you wear out a CD?\nIn short, no. Optical media like CDs and DVDs does not wear out from repeated use. It can degrade or become damaged, however. CDs and DVDs can degrade over time because their recording layers are made with a dye that is extremely photosensitive; it deteriorates when exposed to UV rays over time.\nIs it better to burn a CD fast or slow?\nIt is generally acknowledged as good practice to burn audio CDs at speeds no higher than 4x, but it is also important that you use good-quality blank media specifically designed for low-speed burning. Most computer media these days is designed for very high-speed burning, usually over 24x.\nHow do I burn a high quality CD?\nDO burn at 4X to 10X speed ‚Äì the slower the better with 4X as the optimum. CD burning/writing is a process of writing digital data from your computer hard drive to the blank CD-R in your optical drive. The primary reason why you should not be writing at the fastest burning speed is to reduce errors in the process.\nWhat is the best CD burner software for free?\nAnother free CD burner you can give a try is the Ashampoo Burning Studio Free. This free CD burner does not only have all the basics needed to create data and music discs, but it also includes a few extra features. For instance, you can use it to password protect discs as well as to erase rewritable CDs for reuse.'
 'The SNSR3 SENSOR PHASE BAR FUSE TAP KIT (7141K1002) cannot be used in Sensor racks which were original Sensor Classic or Sensor+ and upgraded to Sensor3.\nExplanation of Issue\nIn order for the kit to fit into the rack it must have suitable threaded PEM receptacles fitted to the bus bars of the rack. These receptacle exist in racks manufactured as Sensor3 racks, but not in Classic or +. The only way to get these in a rack which was originally Sensor Classic or Sensor+ but was upgraded to Sensor3 would be to replace the entire bus bar, and this is not recommended in the field.\nIf you need a tap, an electrician may be able to run one using the NEC "10 foot tap rule" but that is a matter for the electrician and AHJ'
 "This past winter my Dad came to visit. As we drove around Halifax, he pointed to the Nova Scotia Archives and asked if he‚Äôd have to visit me at work there one day. I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said, but I do recall laughing at how absurd and far off that seemed. But this past summer I received an email about a possible internship at the archives. After a phone interview and multiple emails, I was packing my car to head back to Halifax and suddenly my Dad‚Äôs simple question from months before wasn‚Äôt as silly as it had once seemed.\nLocated at the corner of University and Robie, the Nova Scotia Archives has been a fixture in my life at Dalhousie. I was initially introduced to the archives in a first year seminar course called Raiders of the Lost Archives. As part of the course the class took a tour of the archives and we were required to work with archival materials in our final papers. It was at this point that I fell in love with using archival materials. As I had spent time on the research floor for class, I went into the internship with a general understanding of how the public side of the archives worked. This internship let me expand my knowledge to include other parts of the archives, and specifically gave me a greater appreciation for the library collection.\nI began work in July as the Archival Library Services Intern under a Young Canada Works grant. The project, which had begun several months earlier, was to create a unified electronic listing of all materials in the Nova Scotia Archives Special Library. This particular library began in the 1930s to support the Nova Scotia Archives' archival holdings and has continued to grow annually since that time. My project was the foundation for the next phase of library rationalization set to start in the fall. So achieving the goal of a complete listing of the approximately 50,000-item library by the end of my project was very important. While most of my time was spent on the library project, I was also trained to work at the research floor‚Äôs retrieval desk. In this position I developed practical skills and a greater appreciation for all of the work done to assist researchers. Between over-the-phone and in-person interactions, I was astounded by how helpful and knowledgeable everyone is. These aspects extended to the work I was doing because everyone at the archives was willing to take the time to answer any questions. This helped me to better understand the archives as a whole and to see what archivists do on a daily basis.\nAlthough it seemed like a distant possibility this past winter, my internship allowed me to see what it would be like to work at the Nova Scotia Archives. It was a fantastic experience that let me extend my classroom studies into the real world and develop valuable skills. Most importantly, I was given the opportunity to really think about the possibilities for my future."

 'When I was a little girl, I was terrified of the Ku Klux Klan. My mother is Jewish, and while my father is not, and nor were we raised Jewish or affiliated in any overt way, I knew that by Jewish law, and in the eyes of the KKK, I was Jewish too.\nBack in the mid-seventies, our community in Silver Spring was not notably diverse, as it is today; we were among a few (also fractional) Jews; our best friends, the Miller family, were the only African Americans in the neighborhood. In my deep-rooted fears ‚Äì and something that I imagined well and often ‚Äì white-cloaked Klansmen stormed our house with blazing torches held aloft. They would kill my mother, my brother and me, and then burn down the house. I worried most about what would become of Oliver, my dog. I wondered if they would show him mercy since he was a dachshund, as emblematic of the master race, if not as intimidating, as a German Shepherd. My father traveled frequently for work, and I always figured the KKK guys would not be so stupid as to attack when he was home. Then these robed monsters would move to the Miller‚Äôs house, across the street and four houses down at the end of the cul-de-sac, where there they would kill them too. I quite literally imagined my friends Kim and Karen ‚Äì their lifeless bodies hanging from nooses on a tree.\nAs I grew older, this fear of the KKK never vanished, but it did, thankfully, subside. By the time I reached middle school, several other partial Jews, and more Black kids, and Vietnamese and Korean and El Salvadoran and Mexican immigrants ‚Äì refugees, in fact, from all over the world ‚Äì had added character and color to our school and the outlying community. It started to seem like there were more of us than them. And that we could take them on.\nAt the same time, I couldn‚Äôt shake a lingering concern that anti-Semites and bigots lurked silently among us. I developed what some might have called an obsession with the Holocaust. I was not an avid reader but what I did read veered toward true crime macabre and concentration camp memoirs. In typical childlike self-absorption, I became convinced that I was Anne Frank, reincarnated, a suspicion borne out in 1980 when my family visited the Amsterdam house where the Frank family had hidden for years in the attic; I felt quite certain that not only had I been there before, but had spent many nights sequestered in those cramped quarters, grappling with boredom and scribbling in my diary.\nBack at home, I often occupied the few minutes before I fell asleep considering options for if-and-when the Nazis came to power in America. I was thankful for my last name, derived from my Irish Catholic father‚Äôs side. But I knew that would not be enough to save me. I thought about who among our neighbors would take us in. By that time, we‚Äôd moved to a new house, just one block away from our old one; I decided there was enough room in my friend and next-door-neighbor Michelle Baub√©‚Äôs attic ‚Äì not to mention plenty of clothes (for dress-up games and make believe) and stacks of her father‚Äôs Playboys! But maybe the Baub√©s would have to take in the Neri family on the other side of their house, because Mrs. Neri was Jewish too; would there be room for all of us? I decided the Kirwans were likely to take in the Neris. But what about my friends Sydney Dorfman and Pam Epstein who lived in another neighborhood altogether? Syd‚Äôs mother Mary was Catholic but I figured Syd was a goner on account of her last name alone. Pam‚Äôs mother had been a Holocaust survivor herself; she might know what to do. But how would I see them? What if we were sent to different camps?\nOr would I manage ‚Äì as I thought might be possible ‚Äì to somehow escape? I thought of the labyrinth of underground man-sized tunnels that my more courageous friend Sarah McKelvie and I sometimes explored. And the woods behind the YMCA that I knew better than the Viet Cong did the jungles of Vietnam. And the non-Jewish relatives on my dad‚Äôs side who lived like hippies in the California desert ‚Äì maybe I could make it out to them? And if I escaped, would I possess the courage and conviction to fight for the resistance; or would I just lay low?\nPoint being ‚Äì while everybody said Never Again, I was quietly planning for Again.\nAs the years passed, the failure of the KKK to materialize with blazing torches on my lawn, or of the Nazis to make a comeback, emboldened me, and I grew into a young woman fairly unencumbered by fear. But my early professional life was spent in the Balkans and former Yugoslavia, where people of different religions and ethnicities who had lived peaceably side-by-side for decades, suddenly turned on each other. When the first photos emerged of starved Bosnian men behind barbed wire in Serbian-run concentration camps, and stories surfaced of mass rapes and executions, I knew that the fears of my youth had never been unfounded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù could happen again ‚Äì anytime, anywhere.\nWhen I married, I took my then husband‚Äôs last name ‚Äì which I would never use professionally or personally ‚Äì solely based on one fear: what if, after the next Holocaust, I need to be reunited with the children, who might not remember me? I will need some document proving that they are mine.\nAs a kid and adolescent doing a personal deep dive in the Holocaust and the rise of fascism in Germany that preceded it, I was attuned to those ‚Äúmoments‚Äù that seemed like turning points. I remember thinking to myself that I, or at least my family, would have seen the signs before it was too late. We would have refused to ‚Äúregister‚Äù; we would not have acquiesced to wearing yellow arm bands; we would have been long gone before Kristallnacht; for absolute sure, we would not have boarded those trains. I told myself all of this because ‚Äì no matter evidence to suggest that America was different and that what befell Germany and Europe would never happen here ‚Äì in my heart of hearts, I knew that it could.\nHere are some ‚Äúmoments‚Äô in our collective and all-too-recent American history:\n- December 2015: Then presidential candidate Donald J. Trump calls for ‚Äúa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country‚Äôs representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.‚Äù He is applauded and heralded by conservatives across the land.\n- November 2016: The Crusader, official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan and self-branded ‚Äúpremier voice of the white resistance,‚Äù becomes one of the few newspapers to endorse Trump.\n- November 8, 2016: Donald J. Trump ‚Äì a notorious bigot who built a campaign upon fomenting fear, racism and xenophobia; bragged openly about assaulting women; and is known to have kept a bedside copy of Mein Kampf ‚Äì is elected 45th President of the United States of America.\n- January 2017: Newly-elected Trump makes one of his first acts in office Executive Order 13769, suspending the entry of anyone, including refugees and victims of war crimes, from seven ‚ÄúMuslim‚Äù countries. Hundreds of people ‚Äì some American citizens or Green Card holders ‚Äì are inexplicably and indefinitely detained. Hate crimes immediately rise.\n- August 2017: After a white supremacist deliberately drives into a crowd of people peacefully protesting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia ‚Äì killing civil rights activist Heather Heyer and injuring more than 30 others ‚Äì President Trump publicly defends the white nationalists, calling them ‚Äúsome very fine people.‚Äù\n- April 2018: The Trump administration makes public its family separation policy (that in fact was quietly enacted a year prior) intended to deter illegal entry across the Mexican border. Under the policy, federal authorities separate children from their parents or guardians, with adults prosecuted and held in federal jails and children and infants as young as 4-months-old placed in unsanitary and unsafe detention centers. To date, at least seven children have died in immigration custody.\nI could go on. But at the same time, I cannot. My fear and frustration are constantly close to combustion.\nThis blog was prompted by a bad dream. I recognize it‚Äôs tedious to endure other people‚Äôs accounts of their dreams so I‚Äôll try to make it short:\nI awake in my bed to find blood dripping from the ceiling, which for reasons I cannot explain, is made of those styrofoamy drop panels. The blood seeps through the tiles and lands on my bed, staining my white sheets. Drops of blood run in rivulets down my forehead as I move under the source to more closely examine. The ceiling, my sheets, are steeped in red. I decide it‚Äôs best to leave the house, and so I do; but outside, I am unsure where to go. And so I return. My father is there now; he agrees to remove one of the tiles to determine the source of the blood. When he does, poking the tile up and out with a long black umbrella he happens to have on hand, he peers into the crawlspace, and a torrent of thick blood washes down and across my face. Through my matted, bloody hair, I look to my father, who says, ‚ÄúYes it‚Äôs as we expected; there‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs head up there. This is clearly the work of the Klan. They‚Äôre just sending you a warning.‚Äù\nIt was one of those dreams that was so realistic that upon waking, it took me several moments to realize it had only been a dream. With the room still dark, I felt the bed around me ‚Äì no blood. The warm furry body of Brewster, our hound dog, snoring loudly next to me. Next to him, the straw-headed lump of my twelve-year-old son who still sometimes ends up in my bed. On the floor to my left, Scout, our ‚Äúguard dog,‚Äù alert at his post. But still I could feel blood tracing its way down my cheek. I wiped it aside and checked my hand. The wetness was not red; it was not blood, just a tear.\nI heaved a sigh of relief. I swung my feet to one side and planted them on the cold floor. I stood up, and told myself All is well with the world. It was just a bad dream.\nBut I also made a mental note; I have seen enough signs. It is time now. Never Again is and always was a fantasy. But for me, for my children, there will be no such thing as No Escape. I am shifting gears into survival mode. And that is never a pretty but always a necessary thing.\nDonald J. Trump does not frighten me. He is a small, simpleminded stooge of a man. What does frighten me is the fact that ‚Äì Russian interference or not ‚Äì arguably half of America voted for him, implicitly embracing his (albeit inarticulate) platform of fear, anger and entitlement. When I force myself to watch, for however long I can stand it, pro-Trump rallies, what I see is a tidal wave, packed with the flotsam and jetsam of ignorance and hate, breaking over us, destroying everything in its path and all that we‚Äôve accomplished and pushing this once great nation backward in time.']

 "My mom invited us to a Labor Day cookout after we got back from vacation and asked me to bring potato salad. I didn't feel up to making my usual All-American Potato Salad, so I went online for inspiration and found this recipe for Potato Salad.\nI left out the bacon, upped the vinegar for some extra tang and used the method I learned from the All-American Potato Salad to soak the warm potatoes in the vinegar so they absorb the flavor. It was absolutely delicious and easy to make. This one is definitely going in my rotation.\nInspired by The Cutting Edge of Ordinary\n2 1/2 lbs potatoes, scrubbed, skin-on, cut into 1-inch pieces\n4 hard boiled eggs, chopped\n1/2 cup mayonnaise\n1/4 cup sour cream\n1 teaspoon ground mustard\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n3 sprigs of thyme\n2 scallions, thinly sliced\nSalt and pepper\n1/4 cup pickle juice\n3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\nPlace a vegetable steamer in a large pot. Fill with water just until it reaches the bottom of the steamer. Place the potatoes on top of the steamer and cook for approximately 10 minutes, or until a knife can slide easily into them. Drain and put on a baking sheet in a single layer. Add the pickle juice and vinegar and toss to coat the potatoes. Put the baking sheet into the fridge and chill for 30 minutes.\nIn a medium size bowl mix the mayo, sour cream, mustards, hardboiled eggs, thyme, scallions, salt and pepper. You can even make this a day before to really let the flavors infuse.\nOnce the potatoes are cool, stir them into the mayo mixture and stir gently. Refrigerate until cold."
 'One man killed, one wounded in San Bernardino shooting\nSan Bernardino police are investigating a double shooting Tuesday that left one man dead and another wounded.\nGunfire rang out in the early morning in a San Bernardino neighborhood where a homicide occurred earlier this month. Officers received a call at 2:04 a.m. reporting the gunshots near the corner of Mt. Vernon Avenue and Congress Street, according to the Sun.\nOfficers arrived and found a man with gunshot wounds lying in the 200 block of South Lenore Avenue. A second injured man was discovered around the corner from the cul-de-sac, the paper reported.\nOne of the men died at the scene and the other was taken to a hospital. The death was the fourth killing in San Bernardino in six days, and the 11th homicide this month, authorities said.\n-- Angel Jennings\nImage: Approximate location of incident is shown in red.

 'How to Write When the Words Won‚Äôt Flow\nAll writers go through good spells and bad spells. Whether it‚Äôs an afternoon spent staring at a blank screen or months without turning on the computer, not being able to write can cause feelings of hopelessness and frustration.\nIt can take time to rediscover a writing routine. But just as the sun will rise and the tide will turn, the words will come flowing back. In this post, we offer five simple action plans to help set you on your way.\n1. Write about not being able to write\nDon‚Äôt just put the pen on paper; put the pain on paper. Words are still there for you even if you are struggling to string them together right now.\nTake a feeling. Take an image. Take a single word and use it to write a rough, cathartic poem. Repeat, rhyme, rupture‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre in charge. The result won‚Äôt be perfect, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. Keep these frustrated scribbles for future reference: one day you may turn them into something more polished, or if not they will still remind you of how far you‚Äôve come.\nsometimes the words\nyou strive and strain to string\nwords smudge into desolate sheet\nscour the dictionary\ntear the thesaurus\nwrite scrunch write scrunch\nright scrunch you‚Äôve made\ncan‚Äôt create coherent\n2. Read about not being able to write\nThere are countless articles online about overcoming writer‚Äôs block. It‚Äôs not a good idea to trawl through them all, but reading a couple of well-written, inspiring pieces can give you a prod in the right direction.\nKnowing you are not the only writer who feels like giving up can stop you being too hard on yourself. Take a look at Twitter‚Äôs #writingcommunity for a supportive and encouraging space where writers share their insecurities.\n3. Write about ANYTHING\nThis is the least useful advice you could ever give to someone struggling to write. Yet it can also be liberating.\nIf you‚Äôve hit a brick wall with your writing, maybe what you‚Äôre trying to create just isn‚Äôt right for you. Every writer has a unique voice that can be refined through practice. When you choose to write in a certain genre, form or style you are deciding to neglect hundreds more. This is fine when the going is good. But if you‚Äôve lost your way, it could be time to retrace your steps and choose a different path.\nGoing back to basics and reconsidering what you really want to say may propel your writing in a completely new direction. Or it might remind you why you chose your original style in the first place. A lot of the time you‚Äôll end up carrying on with what you had already started, but by taking a step back you‚Äôll have renewed and reaffirmed your passion.\n4. Read about ANYTHING\nNovel, poem, nature magazine or recipe, anything can be a source of inspiration. Try reading:\n- An opinion piece you know you‚Äôll disagree with. Read the article and write a response from the heart. Alternatively, try to put into words the anger you felt as you were reading.\n- Your favourite book. As you‚Äôre reading, think about what the author does that makes you want to come back to their work time and time again.\n- Five poems. Then choose your favourite word/line from each. Combine these into your own poem, edit and gradually work the source material into your own piece. By the time you‚Äôre finished you may no longer have any of the original words in your poem, but starting this way saves you the pressure of seeing an empty page!\n- In another language. If you‚Äôre struggling to write in your mother tongue, remember there are over 7,000 languages spoken in the world! With even a limited vocabulary you can start writing short poems that might just inspire something great in this or your first language.\n5. Take a break\nSometimes taking a break is the best option. Bake some brownies or watch some welly wanging. Do whatever helps you relax. Taking some time away from writing will rekindle your desire and allow you to come back stronger.\nWe hope some of these ideas inspire you to start or resume writing. You can follow @BrieflyWrite on Twitter for more inspiration and tips, and don‚Äôt forget to check out the Briefly Write Prompt Game too.'

Top 5:  ['Is it possible to support PPPOE accreditation on the LAN side of a Balance?\nWe have a ISP that would like to use a Balance in their core network but need to be able to support PPPOE on the LAN side of the Balance for each end user to gain service.\nWould this be possible?\nI know that there is already PPPOE on the WAN of the Peplink to connect to the internet, we now want it on the LAN as well please!\nThis is interesting but can you tell us more why putting a Balance One in a ‚Äúcore network‚Äù? How many PPPOE end users connections are expected to terminate on each Balance One? And why choosing a Balance One for this purpose?\nI didn‚Äôt actually mention Balance ONE but that is what they are using now for some end users and they are familiar with them.\nWe would be recommending one of the bigger units for the core network!\nI believe it will be 5-10 users per Balance and they would like to have speed controls linked to each PPPOE account.\nMy bad. For some reason I keep reading Balance One in my mind.\nBut why having a Balance as PPPOE server? And in this case, I think multi-WAN features are not used, correct?\nWe have got another situation where PPPOE accounts on the LAN will be useful.\nThere are two ways of implementing the load balancing part. 1) clients get balanced between WANS (all traffic from one client goes down a single WAN) and if that WAN fails, they get disconnected and reconnect automatically on another WAN. 2) Clents connect to Balance and then all traffic from Balance is SpeedFusioned back to a data centre where each client has a public IP address. (PPPOE could be done on the Balance or at data centre)'
 'Tati Westbrook Has Put Her Mansion On The Market Just 3 Months After Buying It\nJust four months after buying her home in Los Angeles, the beauty YouTuber has already put it back on the market, reports real estate publication, Dirt. While back then, Tati picked it up for USD $3.3 million (AUD $4.6 million), she‚Äôs now looking to sell it for USD $4 million (AUD $5.6 million), making her a cool $1 million profit.\nThe mansion in LA suburb Sherman Oaks, which has served as the backdrop in hundreds of her YouTube videos, features a butler‚Äôs pantry and wine closet, a plunge pool with raised spa and... an on-site YouTube studio. Handy!\nEven though she bought it just four months ago, YouTuber Tati Westbrook has flipped her Encino home back on the market with a $4 million price tag. Having bought it for $3.3 million, Westbrook stands to rake in a nice profit from the sale. Though they just recently purchased it, the beauty influencer and her hubby have been renting the property for nearly four years and even hired the YouTube-famous design duo Mr. Kate to give their guesthouse a complete makeover üíÑ\nIt‚Äôs also got a built-in cinema, five bedrooms and a total of seven bathrooms. By far the house‚Äôs pi√®ce de r√©sistance, however, would be its ‚Äúremarkable‚Äù (or so says the listing) master suite, which comes complete with a fireplace, spa-style bathroom, massive tub and brass chandeliers. Lovely.\nDedicated fans wouldn‚Äôt be all that surprised by this news. In December, Tati Westbrook told her Instagram fans she was looking to relocate from LA to her hometown of Seattle. Since then, viewers have noticed all of her recent clips have been shot in Washington state.\nThe sale comes just two months after fellow beauty YouTuber Jeffree Star put his own mansion up for sale. Interestingly, Jeffree didn‚Äôt seem to be looking to make a profit. Though he‚Äôd bought the place for USD $3.62 million four years before and had done made countless renovations, the Jeffree Star Cosmetics CEO was only looking to sell the property for $3.6 million.\nYouTuber and cosmetics mogul Jeffree Star is officially waving goodbye to his "Barbie dreamhouse" Calabasas mansion. With interiors painted an almost unsettling shade of Pepto Bismol pink, Star\'s 6,700-square-foot former home is currently listed at a little over $3.5 million. Surprisingly, listing photos don\'t include pics of the perhaps the most interesting part of the house ‚Äî the custom bank vault that Star spent hundreds of thousands of dollars installing that housed his collection of designer goods. More deets and pics of the Star\'s former home in the link in our bio üíÖ\nBut back to Tati, and her reason for selling. To be honest, we don\'t blame her for wanting to leave LA, home to most of the big-name beauty YouTuber stars.\nGiven everything that\'s gone down with her, Jeffree Star, James Charles and Shane Dawson, we can see why she\'d be wanting some space. And probably just a fresh start in a new state, really.

 '- How many minutes does a 700mb CD hold?\n- Why do CDs only hold 80 minutes?\n- Can you add more songs to a burned CD R?\n- How do I burn songs onto a CD?\n- Will CDs last forever?\n- Can you fix scratched CDs?\n- How can I burn more than 80 minutes on a CD?\n- How many tracks can you put on a CD?\n- How do I burn more songs on a CD?\n- What is the highest quality of music?\n- Are there CDs longer than 80 minutes?\n- What is the longest recordable CD?\n- Can you burn music to a DVD?\n- What should I do with old CDs?\n- Can you wear out a CD?\n- Is it better to burn a CD fast or slow?\n- How do I burn a high quality CD?\n- What is the best CD burner software for free?\nHow many minutes does a 700mb CD hold?\nIn most cases a 700MB CD-R will accommodate up to 80min of audio.\n74 minutes is the original Red Book spec (corresponding to 650MB CD-Rs).\nCommercial CDs have been exceeding that for a long time (in a few exceptional cases slightly over 80min)..\nWhy do CDs only hold 80 minutes?\nAudio CDs are not the same thing as data CDs, and they do not contain MP3 files. An audio CD contains audio data in CDDA (Compact Disc Digital Audio) format. ‚Ä¶ A minute of CDDA audio always takes up the same amount of space on the disc, which is why you can only burn a maximum number of minutes to a disc.\nCan you add more songs to a burned CD R?\nBurn additional files to CD-R If the disc is not closed, additional files can be added. When you are ready, place the CD-R into the optical drive, open the CD-R folder, add more files, and then select the Burn to disc option. ‚Ä¶ There is no Burn to disc option to click.\nHow do I burn songs onto a CD?\nTip 1: Burn An Audio CD with Windows Media PlayerStep 1: Insert a blank CD or DVD into your CD/ DVD drive. ‚Ä¶ Step 2: Open Windows Media Player and click on the ‚ÄúBurn‚Äù tab located in the right pane. ‚Ä¶ Step 3: Find the files you want to burn from your Library (Music, Videos, and Pictures) and drag them to the burn list.More items‚Ä¶\nWill CDs last forever?\nAmong the manufacturers that have done testing, there is consensus that, under recommended storage conditions, CD-R, DVD-R, and DVD+R discs should have a life expectancy of 100 to 200 years or more; CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM discs should have a life expectancy of 25 years or more.\nCan you fix scratched CDs?\nFix a Scratched Disc With Wax Incredibly, scratches in the surface of a CD or DVD can be fixed with softened wax! As with the toothpaste fix, you can use shoe polish, lip balm, furniture wax, or even petroleum jelly. Again, rub it into the surface of the disc to fill the scratch.\nHow can I burn more than 80 minutes on a CD?\nLuckily, there is a way to fit a lot more music onto a standard CD than normal‚Äîburn them to an ‚ÄúMP3‚Äù CD. Now, instead of only 80 minutes worth of music you can fit 800MB worth of MP3 files on one CD. Insert a blank CD in your computer‚Äôs CD burner.\nHow many tracks can you put on a CD?\n100 songsA data CD can hold 100 songs. CDs can help transfer files between computers. A blank CD can typically hold about 74 to 80 minutes of music, which is generally not enough to hold 100 songs.\nHow do I burn more songs on a CD?\nHow to Put 200 Songs on One CDClick ‚ÄúStart,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll Programs‚Äù and open Windows Media Player.Click ‚ÄúBurn.‚ÄùSelect ‚ÄúData CD or DVD.‚Äù Drag all 200 of your songs into the window on screen.Put your blank CD-R or CD-RW into your burner.Click ‚ÄúStart Burn‚Äù to burn your 200 songs to your CD.\nWhat is the highest quality of music?\nThe highest quality MP3 has a bitrate of 320kbps, whereas a 24-bit/192kHz file has a data rate of 9216kbps. Music CDs are 1411kbps. The hi-res 24-bit/96kHz or 24-bit/192kHz files should, therefore, more closely replicate the sound quality the musicians and engineers were working with in the studio.\nAre there CDs longer than 80 minutes?\nThe ‚ÄúRedbook‚Äù CD specifications state that CDs contain a maximum of 74 or 80 minutes of music. But over the years, record producers have tried to push that limit.\nWhat is the longest recordable CD?\nLargest Capacity The largest CD-R discs manufactured are 99-minute CD-R discs. For storage, these discs are capable of holding up to 870 MB of data.\nCan you burn music to a DVD?\nA DVD is physically different than a CD, so it will not play in a CD player. While a DVD-audio format exists, very few players will play it, especially in cars. So forget DVDs. A better solution is to convert the audio into MP3 format and burn the MP3 files on to a CD-R formatted as a DATA CD.\nWhat should I do with old CDs?\nGoodwill still sells CDs and DVDs and collects them at its drop-off locations. Many libraries also take them and will either stock them for checkout or sell them at sales or their used stores.\nCan you wear out a CD?\nIn short, no. Optical media like CDs and DVDs does not wear out from repeated use. It can degrade or become damaged, however. CDs and DVDs can degrade over time because their recording layers are made with a dye that is extremely photosensitive; it deteriorates when exposed to UV rays over time.\nIs it better to burn a CD fast or slow?\nIt is generally acknowledged as good practice to burn audio CDs at speeds no higher than 4x, but it is also important that you use good-quality blank media specifically designed for low-speed burning. Most computer media these days is designed for very high-speed burning, usually over 24x.\nHow do I burn a high quality CD?\nDO burn at 4X to 10X speed ‚Äì the slower the better with 4X as the optimum. CD burning/writing is a process of writing digital data from your computer hard drive to the blank CD-R in your optical drive. The primary reason why you should not be writing at the fastest burning speed is to reduce errors in the process.\nWhat is the best CD burner software for free?\nAnother free CD burner you can give a try is the Ashampoo Burning Studio Free. This free CD burner does not only have all the basics needed to create data and music discs, but it also includes a few extra features. For instance, you can use it to password protect discs as well as to erase rewritable CDs for reuse.'

Assistance was also provided to Ministry of Education for developing the national education policy in 2010 through a series of consultations organized by the Task Force consisted of education experts in the country. The policy was endorsed by the Parliament and published in both Bangla and English for wide distribution in the country by the Ministry with support from UNESCO Dhaka.\nUNESCO Dhaka assisted Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) to organize the Second Ministerial Meeting of the South Asia EFA Forum in 2009. The main focus of the Meeting was the strategies to reach the un-reached and decentralized education management. In the ‚ÄòDhaka Declaration‚Äô, the forum made a pledge to allocate at least 6 percent of the GDP in education. The final report of the Ministerial meeting was disseminated to the governments and NGOs of member states as well as development partners. At the same time, there was little follow up at the country level and also regional level including the proposed 3rd Forum Meeting which was agreed to be organized in India in 2011.\nThe Global Action Week (GAW) has been observed every year to promote Education for All. In 2008-2011 The GAW were celebrated in close collaboration with Bangladesh National Commission for UNESCO, Bureau of Non-Formal Education and Campaign for Popular Organization (CAMPE) along with other NGO partners to address the thematic area as a part of broader advocacy in the country. Every year a number of activities such as rallies are organized in many parts of the country to mark the GAW. The aim is to make people aware on the thematic issue as well as Media Professionals Forum for EFA, Policy Roundtable, Press Conference, Education fair, seminars etc were organized.\nDuring the Global Action Week the EFA Global Monitoring Report (GMR) was formally launched every year including a publication ceremony by the MOPME, UNESCO, the Board of Trustees of Transparency International Bangladesh and Dhaka University in 2008.

 'Date / time\n5 December - 6 December, All day\nCourtauld Institute of Art\nThroughout history religion and belief have been the catalyst for the creation of great buildings and works of art. However, religious art has frequently been disputed, despised and destroyed. Members are sought for a research group that will examine the role of reform, ideology and conflict in the destruction and preservation of religious art and architecture. The group will also investigate how theological disputes and religious conflicts have been the impetus for new intellectual and creative approaches to the visual and material arts. The papers presented at the conference will cover 600 years of art history, from fifteenth-century Florence to depictions of Islam after 9/11, and a breadth of topics from medieval monasticism to William Blake‚Äôs theology of art, from Bhutanese seventeenth century art to the Vatican‚Äôs relationship with contemporary art, and much more.\nSpeaker(s): Keynote speakers: James Carley (York University, Toronto / University of Kent) and Sussan Babaie (The Courtauld Institute of Art). Other speakers: Naomi Billingsley (University of Manchester), Michael Carter (The Courtauld Institute of Art), Lloyd De Beer (British Museum / University of East Anglia), Anna Marazuela Kim (University of Virginia), √Ågnes Kriza (University of Cambridge), David Low (The Courtauld Institute of Art), Ariana Maki (University of Colorado Boulder), Anna Messner (University of Munich), Mar√≠a Aurora Molina Fajardo (University of Granada), Scott Nethersole (The Courtauld Institute of Art), Eva Papoulia (The Courtauld Institute of Art), Emily Pegues (The Courtauld Institute of Art / National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.), Jayne Wackett (University of Kent), Lieke Wijnia (Tilburg University)\nFor full information and to book a place:'
 'Hiding in Foursquare‚Äôs revamped mobile app is a feature some users might find creepy: It tracks your every movement, even when the app is closed.\nStarting today, users who download or update the Foursquare app will automatically let the company track their GPS coordinates any time their phone is powered on. Foursquare previously required users to give the app permission to turn on location-tracking. Now users must change a setting within the app to opt out.\nThe update is an extreme shift for five-year-old Foursquare, whose eponymous app is known for a blue button that lets users ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù to popular spots to earn graphical badges. That check-in feature is now gone, part of a new app Foursquare launched in May called Swarm in an effort to find a sustainable business model.\nInstead of earning badges, Foursquare users are now encouraged to leave tips about the places they frequent. They will also get push notifications of recommendations of restaurants and bars based on places they‚Äôve visited. A sushi lover exploring a new town might see suggestions on the best sushi spots automatically appear on her phone without having to open the app.\nTracking user whereabouts could arm Foursquare with more valuable data it can sell to partners and advertisers as it searches for new streams of revenue. The company hopes to analyze trends in where users go and what destinations are popular, and may sell that data to its partners, Chief Executive Dennis Crowley said in an interview.\nBut this type of persistent location tracking could scare off users who are growing increasingly wary of threats to their mobile privacy. A third of smartphone owners surveyed by the Pew Internet & American Life Project in 2012 said they have turned off the location-tracking capability on their devices, and most of those people were motivated by privacy concerns.\nFoursquare‚Äôs app goes beyond location-tracking features offered by competitors. Social apps like Twitter collect GPS coordinates to give users the option of sharing their location with friends, but don‚Äôt collect this data when the app is off. When Facebook introduced a ‚Äúnearby friends‚Äù tool on its mobile app earlier this year, it required uses to opt in to the feature.\nCrowley says more users will be willing to share their location because they‚Äôre getting a more valuable service in return.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been our philosophy since we started that as long as we are recycling the data back to people, people will be interested in using the services,‚Äù the CEO said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just collect a lot of information off people and not doing anything with it. It‚Äôs not a fair trade.‚Äù\nThat tradeoff wasn‚Äôt provided by Goldenshores, the developer of a flashlight app for Android phones which collected users‚Äô location data and gave no clear explanation for why. The Federal Trade Commission settled with the company, mandating that it ‚Äúclearly and prominently‚Äù explain to users why and how it collects such data.\nYour real-time location is not shared on the Foursquare app. If you write a tip, like or otherwise interact with a place, users may infer that you have been to that location. Some content, like tips, are time stamped and other users could use that information to infer when you were at a place even though tips can be posted when you aren‚Äôt at the place you are leaving a tip about.\nFoursquare may need to take extra steps to educate users the privacy implications of its new app, said Justin Brookman, director of the Center for Democracy & Technology‚Äôs Project on Consumer Privacy.\n‚ÄúPersistent location tracking is the sort of thing that you should have to affirmatively decide to turn on, and if it‚Äôs not evident from the nature of the app, I think they have an obligation to clearly message to you that it will be constantly collecting location information in the background,‚Äù Brookman said in an email.\nFoursquare uses your phone‚Äôs background location to help you find great places, and the best tips for when you‚Äôre there. You can change this at any time in your settings.\nRegarding the data Foursquare collects, Crowley said trend data provided to partners would never include users‚Äô real names.\n‚ÄúWe might look at anonymized trends and say, there‚Äôs a high density of people who like ribs and Arnold Palmers in the East Village,‚Äù he said. Advertisers ‚Äúmight be really excited about getting their hands on that data,‚Äù he said.\nRelated: Douglas Macmillan has details on digits.\nFor the latest news and analysis, follow @wsjd\nGet breaking news and personal-tech reviews delivered right to your inbox.\nMore from WSJ.D: And make sure to visit WSJ.D for all of our news, personal tech coverage, analysis and more, and add our XML feed to your favorite reader.'
 'Following the Efficient Frontier search CPC (cost per click) trends release, we are now sharing the Display CPM (cost per thousand impression) and volume trends for April 2011.\nFigure 1: Display Trends ‚Äì April 2011\nApril 2011, being the start of a new quarter, saw a pullback in overall Impression volume in Display. This is not unusual for two reasons. The first is that Q1 is historically a strong quarter for Display (particularly in sectors like Finance), and the second is that advertisers who are nearing the end of a quarterly or annual fiscal period may want to spend unused ad budgets.\nIt is important to note that volume is up more than 150% YoY (year over year) as advertisers continue to put more of their budgets into Display to take advantage of ROI opportunities and the cross-channel benefits with SEM and Display.\nCPM levels have increased by more than 60% MoM (month over month) to correspond with the decline in impression volume. As advertisers via sophisticated Display platform are able to better find and market to their target audience, there becomes a greater willingness to pay higher amounts for this high quality, in market traffic.']

 '‚ÄòImagine you have a business. You‚Äôve built it up through hard work and effort. It‚Äôs worth $1.0 million to you.Suddenly the sales start going down. Your livelihood is in jeopardy. Your wife and family‚Äôs livelihood are in jeopardy. What do you want from me? Fine writing? Or would you like to see the goddam sales curve stop going down and start going up?‚Äô\nWhat I‚Äôll do for you\nIf what you want from me is to boost sales, then Rosser Reeves‚Äôs statement above sums up what I will do for you.\nBecause, if you‚Äôre going to pay me or anyone else, money, then either one of us is going to have to make even more for you from your investment, shouldn‚Äôt we?\nFine writing is fine, but I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôll prefer writing that makes your sales curve go up and up!\nAre you tired of seeing your sales go down? Worried how you‚Äôll pay your staff, your rent, and yourself? Worried how you‚Äôll pay off your inventory and the bills?\nSome of you have invested way too much for your business to fail. Money is one‚Ä¶ Time is another. I‚Äôm sure some of you have invested lots of time.. Time that sometimes takes you away from your family. Or takes you away from your children‚Ä¶ And you reach home only when your children are asleep, and leave before they wake.\nDon‚Äôt want to lose your precious invested time, sweat, blood tears and money to a downturn?\nNot to worry, I‚Äôm here for you.\nAre you a bicycle shop or small business owner?\nAre you looking to open a bike shop? Are you a small business looking to distribute? Or are you already a bike shop owner or distributor, and looking to boost your sales?\nThanks to my last job (for which I‚Äôm utterly grateful for) I‚Äôve had a few good years doing sales and marketing. I sold mid to high-end road bicycles, and have learnt quite a lot about getting sales.\nAnd more importantly‚Ä¶ Getting repeat sales!\nWhat I can tell you is that many are leaving money on the table, simply because they neglect to do some things.. Or to even do some things more often.\nSimple things ignored\nI‚Äôm not going to lie to you, these are simple things that can and should be done for businesses like yours to get more sales.\nBut yet, many don‚Äôt do it.\nYou‚Äôre probably thinking, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs so simple, why aren‚Äôt people doing it?‚Äù\nShouldn‚Äôt getting sales be a simple thing? Open a shop.. Run some advertisements.. Ask friends to promote your shop and location etc etc.\nMake no mistake though, the simplest things have complicated and detailed thought put into them, are well-designed and do such a good job that you don‚Äôt stop to think twice about it.\nYou just keep using it over and over again.\nThe simplest things become invisible to the users, and ignored and taken for granted by most.\nAn example of the simplest thing\nWhen was the last time you looked at your doorknob?\nThis is an example of the simplest thing, well-designed, doing its job well ‚Äì which is to let you open the door or keep it closed behind you ‚Äì and ignored by many.\nBut yet, just think how much engineering and manufacturing know-how went into designing a doorknob that won‚Äôt fail after decades of use? A doorknob that doesn‚Äôt break, is ergonomic, fits into your hand well and doesn‚Äôt pinch your flesh during use?\nIf you‚Äôd like to improve your business and make more money, why not let me take a look and see how it can be done for you?\nThese will be simple ideas that have detailed thought behind them.\nThese will be ideas and tactics boost your sales and bottom line.\nAnd if you‚Äôre one of the few who end up knowing what you‚Äôre doing with your marketing, don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôd survive better, do better and make more?\nAfter all, if you looked at the number of businesses and bicycle shops that opened in recent years, you‚Äôll notice that many of them have shut down as well.\nIs it possible for you hit $300,000 in sales a month? More often?\nAnd if you‚Äôre also selling a range of mid to high-end products, there is no reason why you, as a bicycle shop or retail owner, cannot hit $300,000 in sales figures at least a few times a year. (And you should be selling at least one high-end item, because that‚Äôs where the money will be for you.)\nWhy not $300,000 every month? That‚Äôd be great, and not impossible, for sure!\nBut I won‚Äôt make you empty promises that you can make $300,000/month immediately.\nThings like these take time. And if you‚Äôre in the long run for your business as I will be for yours, it means that both of us are invested for the long-term.\nNow, if you looked at your retail sales curve for the past few years, you‚Äôd notice at least 2 gradual dips during certain months of the year.\nThe lowest dips would probably be June/July and November/December, when people start going on holidays, and you have less walk-in customers.\nNow, could campaigns be planned to bolster quiet months?\nOf course they can.\nThe simplest thing you can do for your livelihood\nDon‚Äôt wait till you‚Äôre struggling before you seek help. Remember, it takes time for even a strong oak tree to grow. Why wait for a downturn take away your business and affect the livelihood of you and your family?\nRemember, it is the simple things you do that will help your business.\nThe simplest thing you can do right now, is to fill out the contact form below to find out what I can do for you, today!\nRemember, I sell and I write to sell‚Ä¶ Or your money back. Guaranteed.\nDon‚Äôt take what I say for granted. See what some customers had to say about me:\nFrom my personal experience and observation with Theo‚Ä¶ he appreciates and knows that this is one of the most powerful marketing and sales techniques any business can employ.\nI felt I was talking to a friend and fellow bike enthusiast instead of a sale person. He gained my trust. Base on my personal experience and observation of Theo‚Äôs work ethic and his engaging personality, I believe he will be a valuable addition to any institution.\nWhat made Theo convince me to buy was his ability to build rapport and connect with people, and his sincerity and understanding of what customers really want. In my opinion, many business models lack understanding of business ethics, customer satisfaction, and after-sales service support, as well as the power of customers‚Äô word of mouth. Theo‚Ä¶ took pride in his work and managed to give me the conviction and satisfaction moving forward.\nP.S. One complaint you may have is your magazine ad not getting you any enquiries or business at all. This is where copywriting comes in. Good copywriting makes your ad get you a response.\nHowever, copywriting and marketing go hand-in-hand, and your sales processes also play a huge part.\nImagine if you had a successful ad that brought people to your shop, but they received poor service.. Guess where they will go to air their grievances?\nFacebook. Or online forums.\nThey will tell their friends, and their bad experience will spread like wildfire. Your successful ad, through no fault of its own, just had an opposite effect on your business.\nBut only because your marketing and sales process wasn‚Äôt looked into first.\nThis is why you find that most, if not all, direct response copywriters also provide marketing and consultant services. It all goes hand in hand to make your business successful.\nIf you want to improve your sales and business, don‚Äôt wait, let me help. Drop me a note today!\nTo repeat, I sell and I write to sell‚Ä¶ Or your money back. Guaranteed.'
 'The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect at midnight on January 1, 1994. That night, thousands of Indigenous Mayans rose up in arms in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas, seizing at least five towns and declaring NAFTA a "death certificate" for people like themselves. This was just the beginning of Mexico\'s troubles in a year that brought countless protests, hotly disputed elections and the assassinations of two of the then-ruling party\'s leaders. 1994 ended with a sudden devaluation of the peso, the start of an economic collapse from which the country didn\'t recover fully for years.\nNAFTA is back in the news this month: On August 16, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met with his counterparts from Canada and Mexico, the other two NAFTA nations, to open talks on renegotiating the pact.\nWhile it\'s true that NAFTA was just one of the many problems Mexico had in the 1990s, we have to wonder, given the renewed focus on the trade accord, why US mainstream media have carried so little discussion of the events that accompanied NAFTA\'s rollout in Mexico. The reason may be a consensus among opinion makers about NAFTA and similar trade pacts.\nIt is an article of faith across party lines that these accords are beneficial to our trading partners in the Global South. On the right, we have President Trump, who told CBS during the campaign that "Mexico ... is taking our jobs. I love the Mexican people. They\'re great people. But the leadership is too smart for our country.... We\'re being defrauded by all these countries." On the other side, we have commentators who insist that NAFTA\'s been good for the US economy but still go along with Trump\'s claim that Mexicans benefit from it. Some even assert that these trade pacts are the only hope for the developing world.\nThe numbers tell a different story. In 2009, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report on Mexico after 15 years of NAFTA. The researchers found some positive results -- including trade growth and an 80 percent productivity increase in the manufacturing sector -- but little improvement in areas such as economic growth, inequality and the disparity between Mexican and US wages. Interestingly, the worst news was about jobs. The export assembly plants known in Mexico as maquiladoras gained some 660,000 jobs, most of them probably manufacturing jobs outsourced from the United States and lost to workers here. But at the same time, NAFTA\'s lifting of protective tariffs left Mexico\'s family farms unable to compete against imports from US-subsidized agribusiness firms. The result was the disappearance of 2.3 million jobs in Mexico\'s agricultural sector -- a net loss of some 1.6 million jobs for Mexicans.\nThis helps explain a sharp increase in Mexican migration to the United States "from about 350,000 per year before NAFTA to nearly 500,000 per year by the early 2000s," according to the report. Many of these immigrants are the unauthorized residents Trump is now deporting.\nIt\'s true that NAFTA produced some winners. Mexican telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim moved into the top 10 on Forbes\' list of the world\'s billionaires, Walmart became Mexico\'s largest private employer, and US corporations like Archer Daniels Midland, Bartlett Grain and Cargill profited handsomely from our country\'s agricultural exports to Mexico, worth $17.7 billion in 2016. NAFTA critics suggest that trade accords negotiated behind closed doors by business-oriented experts are bound to produce results like these and that future negotiations should be handled by the people left behind in previous pacts.\nIn fact, there have been several efforts to bring together civil society groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States to formulate demands for a more equitable accord. The DC-based nonprofit Global Trade Watch has been promoting the idea for years, and a meeting in Mexico City in May this year has set the project in motion. The agenda would include proposals to create or strengthen protections for labor organizing, for small-scale farming, for the environment, and for the rights of women and people of color -- along with a more rational approach to migration than what we have now.\nThese grassroots efforts are important, although they aren\'t likely to sway the policy makers in the short term. US negotiator Lighthizer talked tough on August 16, telling the press that "NAFTA has fundamentally failed many, many Americans and needs major improvement," but a letter he sent Congress in May suggests that the Trump administration will actually go ahead with what is pretty much a modernized version of the old NAFTA, its flaws intact.\nStill, at the very least, we can use the new attention on trade to start dispelling the fantasy that NAFTA was a giveaway to Mexico. This was never a conflict between the people of the NAFTA nations; the conflict was between the super-rich and all the rest of us, and we\'re the ones who have been losing.\nOriginal article can be found here:'

 'To Hell With God is the tenth release by Tampa-based death metal band Deicide, and was released February 15, 2011 as the band‚Äôs first release under Century Media records.\nKnown as one of the original, best, and most brutal death metal bands in the history of the genre, Deicide have never ceased to assault and please ears with each new release. In their history the band has seen little transformation or deviance from their relentless sound, though the lineup changes post-2004 when the Hoffman brothers ceased their guitar-playing duties with the band. To many cries of ‚Äúnot as good as before!‚Äù Deicide have still managed to put out another album that‚Äôs stands true to the genre they helped pioneer.\nThere is but one unescapable truth regarding To The Hell With God: while it falls directly in line with the post-2004 releases it lacks a certain leaded fury that was delivered when Deicide enlisted the Hoffman brothers. Unlike many accounts I‚Äôve encountered, however, I think this is both a good and bad thing. Let‚Äôs start with why this sucks. Deicide were most certainly one of the heaviest and most brutal bands that seemed to get as close as possible to the ‚Äúover the top‚Äù mark into the ‚Äúsilly‚Äù territory, and seemed to be masters of doing so, but they‚Äôre no longer quite as close to that mark, almost as if they‚Äôve let off the throttle a bit.\nOutweighing the negatives of being heavy to the brink of silliness is that the production is leaps and bounds better than the band had once featured on their albums. Glen Benton‚Äôs vocals are perhaps the best they‚Äôve ever been and you can actually hear them in the mix‚Äìas you can each of the instruments in the band. There is nothing lost amidst the overwhelming heaviness of the album that Deicide occasionally fell prey to. With this more modern sound for the band also comes a more modern style of death metal than perhaps diehard Deicide fans are used to, but it‚Äôs closer to the classic Deicide than Till Death Do Us Part and The Stench Of Redemption.\nQuite literally, the only ‚Äúfault‚Äù of the album is that it‚Äôs not exactly like the Deicide of old, but I‚Äôm not complaining. To Hell With God is a great album, and it is fantastic to hear a classic band staying relevant by bringing their creativity and influence to the table in order to help reshape the genre in which they were of the first contributors to. Song after song, album after album, Deicide continue to show us why they‚Äôre a deserving candidate for the throne of death metal king.\nSong picks: ‚ÄúEmpowered By Blasphemy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow Can You Call Yourself A God‚Äù\nScore: 9/10 Devil Horns']

They actually wound up loving them more than the meal that I paired with them! I only had the dry spices, so I did the proper conversion and they still tasted great. These biscuits aren\'t over the top flavorful, but they are subtle and taste fresh. One side note, my biscuit mix came out looking wayyyy too dry (there were still piles of dry ingredient in the bowl), so I added a bit of whole milk to thin it out. They were still thick enough to be drop biscuits, and it didn\'t effect taste (as far as I can tell). Give these a try if you want a biscuit that\'s not heavy with cheese or garlic. I will be making these again.UPDATE: I made these again this evening and halved the recipe for just my husband and I. I\'m sick so I wasn\'t paying enough attention. By the time I was ready to put them on the baking sheet, I realized that I had used the FULL amount for the oil and buttermilk. Instead of starting over or adding more of the dry ingredients to even it out, I just went ahead and tried it. They turned our pretty good! Not as light and fluffy but still good! Goes to show how forgiving this recipe is."\n"These were very good. The fresh herbs made them so tasty!"\n"The flavor of these were delicious. Instead of using fresh basil I used 2 tsp. Dried basil. I also used regular milk not buttermilk. I make a lot of drop biscuits bc they\'re my family\'s favorite and I always use regular milk in them. For these I would use 1 1/4 cup milk or buttermilk to make the dough not as stiff. For the drop biscuits I make the dough is never that stiff so they come out fluffier. That\'s the only thing I would do differently and I\'ll be making these a lot more!!!"\n"So easy and yummy! I use a gluten free flour for my celiac family. They just love these."\n"This was a perfect side with pasta."\n"Quick and easy to bake. Delicious with the fresh herbs."'

 'The United States claims that Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, owns the mega-yacht Tango.\nThe US government has seized a mega-yacht in Spain owned by an oligarch with close ties to the Russian president, the first of the government‚Äôs sanctions enforcement initiative to ‚Äòseize and freeze‚Äô giant boats and other expensive property from Russian elites.\nSpanish Civil Guard and US federal agents descended on the yacht on Monday at the Marina Real in the port of Palma de Mallorca, the capital of Spain‚Äôs Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe United States had issued an arrest warrant for the vessel, named the Tango, alleging it ‚Äúwas subject to forfeiture for violation of United States bank fraud, money laundering and sanctions laws,‚Äù the official said. US Department of Justice in a statement.\nDocuments related to the US investigation allege Viktor Vekselberg bought the Tango in 2011 and used front companies to hide his interest in the ship, the Justice Department said.\nVekselberg, who was sanctioned by the United States in 2018, used American banks to make Tango-related payments in violation of those sanctions, the department said.\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland said this was the first US seizure of property from a Russian-sanctioned individual and ‚Äúwill not be the last‚Äù.\n‚ÄúTogether with our international partners, we will do everything we can to hold accountable any individual whose criminal acts allow the Russian government to continue its unjust war,‚Äù Garland said in the statement, referring to the ongoing invasion of Russia.

 'BROOMFIELD, Colo. (CBS4) ‚Äì The smoke from the High Park Fire is causing its own problems as smoke kept the air tankers grounded part of the day on Sunday.\nAs of Sunday night eight 20-person crews and other firefighters were on scene. Air resources included five single engine air tankers (SEATS); two Type 1 helitankers; two Type 3 helicopters; three heavy air tankers; air attack; and lead plane.\nApproximately 15 engines are also on scene. A Type 1 management team has been ordered and is expected to take over management Monday morning. Additional ground, air, and engines have been ordered.\nThere was a steady flow of air activity at the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield on Sunday. Aircraft from as far away as Canada, Montana and Nevada were at the airport to help fight the fire.\nThe aircraft will land for about 10 minutes as the ground crew comes in and replenishes loads of fire retardant to drop around the fire. In this case the planes fly about 20 minutes to the target, drop the retardant and then return for another pickup.\nThe large noisy planes attracted a crowd of people on Sunday.

 'NHMEP Economic Impact Report\nThe Economic Impacts of the New Hampshire Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program on the New Hampshire Economy\n2 Year Executive Summary ‚Äì March 2020\nIMPACT TO NH MANUFACTURERS\nThe New Hampshire Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program is supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the U.S. Dept. of Commerce to help small- and medium-size manufacturers identify and implement advanced manufacturing and management technologies. Through a network of resources, the MEP links client firms with local and national sources of expertise to address specific problems. This study estimates the total economic contribution to the New Hampshire economy from firms whose employment, sales, or investment activity changed as a direct result of assistance provided by the New Hampshire MEP.\nNew Hampshire MEP clients are surveyed, by an independent third party survey company, to determine the economic impact resulting from their relationship with the MEP program. Clients are surveyed roughly one year after the completion of a project and asked a number of questions relating to changes in efficiency and output as well as questions relating to the quality of the MEP services they received. 117 companies surveyed over the past two years reported that as a result of their relationship with New Hampshire MEP they have experienced:\nIncreased or Retained Sales\nIMPACT TO NH ECONOMY\nThe effects of this increased economic activity extends beyond the client firms. Increased sales by New Hampshire MEP client firms require that they increase their purchases of intermediate goods and services from companies located in New Hampshire and elsewhere to support their increased output. The supplying companies, in turn, generate additional demands of their own. In this way, dollar expenditures for final demand can be traced backward to all of the affected industries in the regional economy. In addition, the income from new jobs generated by New Hampshire MEP clients and the supplying firm‚Äôs results in increased demand for consumer goods. Each of these effects, in turn, generates subsequent ripples throughout the New Hampshire economy. The sum of these direct, indirect, and induced effects suggests that small- and medium-size manufacturing companies that increased or retained jobs or sales and/or increased investments with assistance from the New Hampshire MEP are responsible for.\nCreated or Retained Jobs that paid $151M in employee wages and benefits\nIncreased or retained economic output\nContributed or Retained Gross State Product\nGenerated or Retained in additional tax and non-tax revenues at the Federal, state and local government levels\nGenerated or Retained in additional tax and non-tax revenues at the state and local level\n1 No client is surveyed more than once in a 12 month period.

 "Then the LORD God said, ‚ÄúBehold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever‚Äù‚Äî therefore the LORD God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. So He drove out the man; and He placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.\nGenesis 3:22 - 24\nIn Strong‚Äôs Concordance the word ‚Äòforever‚Äô [`owlam] corresponds to Strong‚Äôs Number H5769 and occurs 439 times in the Old Testament records of the KJV according to Strong's concordance.\nConceptual meanings of ‚Äòforever‚Äô [`owlam] (depending on the context):\n1. Main concept is of continual or continuing, enduring, unceasing, unending duration. The focus is on the intended duration.\n2. Perpetual duration, long duration, limitless duration, non terminating duration.\n3. Of permanence, everlasting.\nAnd the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,\nGenesis 3:4 (YLT)\n‚Äò..... you shall surely die‚Äô\nThe corresponding counter argument or statement of the Serpent as a proxy for Satan would be:\n‚Äò..... you surely will not die‚Äô\nrather than the deceitfully twisted translation by all the Bible translators:\n‚Äò..... you will not surely die‚Äô\nWhile Genesis 3:4 and also verse 5 would read (as more accurate rendered in NASB):\nThen the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou surely will not die. For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.‚Äù\n‚ÄòFor God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.‚Äô\nSome of the concepts covered in this one verse are as below:\n2. GOD‚Äôs great love.\n3. The world.\n4. GOD‚Äôs giving as in ‚ÄòGOD gave‚Äô.\n5. Only begotten.\n7. The term ‚Äòwhoever‚Äô.\n8. Believing in the SON.\nFor God(1) so loved(2) the world(3) that He gave(4) His only begotten(5) Son(6), that whoever(7) believes in Him(8) should not perish(9) but have(10) everlasting(11) life(12).\nWe shall not discuss all the concepts covered in this one verse but just a few key ones to illustrate that words are the encapsulation of concepts that they are used to convey in communications.\nFor a start let us look at the concepts encapsulated in the words ‚Äòperish, everlasting and life‚Äô. In the simplest of context we would know as mortal men and women that we die. There is an end to our life. So whenever we encounter the word 'perish' as it relate to us, we can get the context of a ceasing of life, or of losing or loss of life.\nNow contrast the phrase 'should not perish' against 'but have everlasting life.' From that context we would understand that 'perish' here refers to a cessation of life and not a forever life in the torment of hell as has been the twisted teachings of the Christmas religion. Read the book of John chapter 10 verse 28 where this concept is reinforced by a statement from JESUS.\nIn the New Testament Scriptures, the word 'perish' had been used in several contexts. These are: the losing or lost of something, the destruction or destroying of something, or the coming/bringing/putting to an end of something. So the primary or base concept is that of 'a cessation' or 'an ending' of possession.\n'Everlasting' should need no explanation as the concept is that of forever ongoing, having no ending. Therefore, because of our mortality in that every human who had ever lived before us had died, and we in our time expect the same, we should be able to understand that it would mean that there will be no end or unending.\nIn 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 18 the same word everlasting is here translated as 'eternal.' This verse contrasts it against the word 'temporary.' So we should get the idea of a permanent condition or state as oppose to a temporary condition or state. So the primary or base concept expressed in the word translated as either 'everlasting' or 'eternal' is that of a continual state, an unceasing or unending state. That is, the concept of permanence.\nYes there are a few instances where this word is left out or erroneously translated because the translators just have no idea how to fit the word into the context or subject that it qualified or described.\nwhile we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.\n2 Corinthians 4:18\nI hope you can see the context from the contrast of these words and get the whole picture or over riding precept of comparing life that is temporary against that which is permanent. The word translated as 'life' in the Gospel and New Testament accounts comes mostly from two main Greek words. One of these was used almost exclusively to reference a life that is permanent and was associated with the word eternal and everlasting.\nThe other word translated as 'life' on the other hand was used almost exclusively to reference one that pertains to the temporary, often also translated in the King James Version of the Bible as soul or breath. The concept here of this word is of a life sustained by this 'breath' or 'drawing of air into the body'.\nBut the Mystery Babylonian religion that originated from Nimrod's wife had got almost all of religious mankind and even many among those who are professed atheist, deceived into a 'doctrine of the immortal human soul'. In the context of the discussion here on the words 'perish', 'everlasting' and 'life', this could be termed a doctrine of the 'indestructible human soul'.\nThe almost universal view of religious man for thousands of years prior to the current age of scientific 'enlightenment' has being that the 'immortal' souls of wicked sinners who have died going to a purgatory of eternal punishment, whether these be of physical torture or the forever torment of a burning hell fire. As for those who have lived a pure sinless life, they would on their death ascend to the heaven to live forever where the gods are, some teachings also have that these becoming deities themselves elevating themselves solely by their perfect virtuous lives or selfless sacrifices. Further there had also been this belief of another category of afterlife for those among the less extreme who will continue their lives in another world or realm of the 'after life' neither in purgatory nor as deities.\nAll the Scriptures of the New Testament records consistently portrayed two primary concepts in the words translated as life in the Christian Bible; one is temporary and the other permanent. The temporary one ending at death which is the termination, cessation or ending of life and not a continuous life in a hell of eternal torment as are the doctrines that had originated from the Babylonian religions which is sourced to the first family, Adam and Eve, believing or trusting a strange talking serpent in the Garden of Eden rather than the GOD who created them.\n‚Äò Then the serpent said to the woman, ‚ÄúYou will not surely die.... ‚Äô\nMore accurately translated it would say, 'You surely won't die' or 'You definitely won't die' or 'You will surely never die'.\nIn the doctrine of the Babylonian religions it would read, 'You have an immortal soul'. And that is what near to all the religions of the world teach because their source is the very religion that Nimrod started when he made himself a king to rule over the people leading them to rebel against their CREATOR GOD and KING (Malachi 1:14; 1 Samuel 12:12, 8:6 ‚Äì 7). All these religions are built on Satan's lie.\nUp until today mankind had not believed what GOD said when HE commanded Adam not to eat from that Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,\n' but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die '\nThey had continued on believing the lie of that serpent until this very day.\n1.

 'Pew pew time is upon us! The X-Wing season is in full swing.\nI‚Äôm out of the loop at the moment as I wait for the Veteran Defender title cards to come into force, but my brother Ben got stuck into a tournament at our local FLGS at the weekend. He‚Äôs written a account of his day, and being the awesome older brother I am I said I‚Äôd share it. Enjoy!\nOn Sunday 31st 23 players got together at Fistful of Dice for their second winter tournament, a very high number considering the first tournament drew in about 16. X-Wing is going strong in our area.\nAt that tournament I won 3 and lost 2 with a Horton/Stresshog/Luke list which bagged me 7/16 position. This time around after some testing I decided on using the following:\nDash with PtL, EU, HLC, title and Intel Agent\n2 x Rookie X-Wings with R2‚Äôs and IA\nAfter using the stresshog and TLT for 2/3 months I had gotten bored of just chipping away and wanted to dish out a lot of punishment. As I‚Äôd used Dash quite often he was the perfect choice. After trying him with Kyle crew alongside a regen Poe I came to the conclusion I can‚Äôt fly Poe for love nor money so ditched Kyle so I could use the 2 rookies. This way I‚Äôve one more gun and at least 10 red dice each round. As a squad I hadn‚Äôt used this much, so should make for an interesting day!\nRound 1: Andrew with TLT Horton, Poe and 2 Bandits\nWhilst setting up we both said how we get nervous before a tournament and how it normally takes a round to get warmed up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.we did not have a chance with this game!\nI set up Dash on the left and the X-Wings on the right, this way my opponent has to make a choice. His ships were across the middle so I slow rolled to see what he was doing. The Bandits and Horton went after my rookies whilst Poe came for Dash. We traded shot and finally were left with Dash on 1 hull and Poe on 2. Dash was stressed but I knew I had to kill Poe as it was my only way of winning so couldn‚Äôt turn in to block. I instead took a 3 turn to the left to make distance for one last shot. Poe was behind a rock at this and made a gentle 1 bank which meant he landed on the rock, no actions and shot! I rolled my 4 dice and‚Ä¶.4 hits! Poe couldn‚Äôt evade and I took the match. We had a crowd around us for that last turn and to say it was stressful is an understatement. Some might call that a lucky win but to do well in these tournaments a bit of luck is needed.\nRound 2: Wayne with Vessery, Dark Curse, Black Squad Punisher and another named TIE\nMy next opponent hadn‚Äôt been playing for very long, he‚Äôd bought a few ships ages ago but never got round to actually playing until recently. The Punisher had homing missiles and torpedoes (I can‚Äôt remember which) with extra munitions but fortunately both were R2-3 so I knew what I had to do. I set up the same way as the first game, with the Punisher and Vessery going after the Rookies and the two named TIE‚Äôs going Dash.\nTwo lessons learnt here; don‚Äôt TL Dark Curse (waste of an action) and don‚Äôt K-turn your X-Wings too early! This ended up with my Rookies being in a very bad position with no shots but within R1 of the Punisher and Vessery, Luckily for me they both survived this and I went on to comfortably win this match up losing only one Rookie. So far my red dice have been crazy hot which was helping me a lot.\nRound 3: Stephen with Etahn, 2 Blue Sqds and 2 Bandits\nYou can tell what Stephen‚Äôs plan was here just by looking at the list, he sat Etahn in the middle of his formation in the centre of the board. Again Dash was on the left and the X‚Äôs to the right. I was not looking forward to the amount of crits coming my way‚Ä¶\nMy Rookies immediately did 2 turns to the right so they could come back in for a good run at his formation, Dash slow rolled forward. Stephen made his choice and went turned towards Dash, some shots were fired at R3 but no serious damage was taken. The next round was where the fun for Stephen would begin and we both knew it.He moved his whole formation forward 2 to try and catch Dash bang to rights but I 1 banked to the left with the hope I‚Äôll be able to boost past. I ended up bumping into one B (yay!) giving a Z an R1 shot but luckily Dash had moved up enough that he was out of arc of the rest of the formation (double yay!!). At this point my X-Wings had snuck up and were now flanking his squad, I then went about taking a ship off the board each turn, I think I lost one Rookie. I liked this but think that he should have slowed down at the start to give himself more time to get me in arc.\nSide note: I hadn‚Äôt gotten this far into a tournament with all wins so I was extremely pleased with myself!\nRound 4: Cadan with Miranda, Poe and Stresshog\nI knew as soon as I saw Cadan‚Äôs, a current Regional Champs, list at the start of the day that I didn‚Äôt want to go up against it but on the plus side I was on the top table so happy days! I knew that the the Y-Wing had to go first and then I‚Äôd have to kill either Poe or Miranda quickly so they couldn‚Äôt regen shields. I started as normal but knew I had to get to the Y quickly so my Rookies blasted parallel down my edge of the board to meet up with Dash. I managed to destroy the Y within 2 turns of shooting but he had done his job and double stressed Dash (which I had managed to fly into the corner, silly Ben). With no way of getting out of arc Poe and Miranda quickly took him out. My Rookies; who had been heroes all day, fell quickly leaving me with a heavy loss which would cost me third place.\nI‚Äôll be finding someone to fly this list again so I can practice against it, it‚Äôs frustrating but I‚Äôm sure I can beat it with this squad.\nRound 5: Steve with Super Dash and Poe\nThis was a fun game! Neither of us had ever played Dash v Dash and we had never played each other before so we didn‚Äôt know how aggressive/defensive the other would be, we soon found out. We both had HLC and the title, the only difference being he had Kyle crew.\nMy first thought was to destroy Poe as quickly as possible after the last game but Steve‚Äôs Dash presented himself first so my Rookie‚Äôs managed to strip most of his shields. His Dash then ran off for a bit whilst my squad managed to strip the shields from Poe. Then the turning point. After my first Rookie was destroyed my second Rookie managed to destroy Poe at R3 with no modifiers, definitely deserved a promotion! We both stood there in shock trying to work out how that had happened but to say I was pleased was an understatement.\nIt was down to the two Dash‚Äôs, just what we thought would happen! Mine had 7HP left whereas Steve‚Äôs had only his 5 hull. We danced around for a few rounds, Steve managing to keep within R1 until I took a punt and did a 3 turn away. By this point we were both one good attack from dying so there was the possibility we could destroy each other in the same round due to simultaneous fire! Due to my Dash having slightly more hull left I managed to survive his attack but with a focus and a TL my 4 hits were too much for him.\nSo in the end I finished with 4 wins and 1 loss which put me at 20pts. This left me in 4th place for the day which I was very happy with. The loss to Cadan hit my MOV pretty hard (could have had 3rd) but overall a cracking result and my best showing in a tournament!\nAnything learnt? Yeah, firstly Intel Agent was pointless. I‚Äôll be going for the initiative bid next time or using Nien Numb instead to give me more options after PtL. Secondly, Integrated Astromech is awesome. In each game one my Rookie‚Äôs survived a round or two more because of it which helped immensely.\nThere are more tournaments coming up so we‚Äôll see what happens.'

Low 5:  ['The EU demanded Monday the ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù halt of Russian air strikes against moderate Syrian rebel groups and warned a lasting peace was impossible under Moscow-backed President Bashar al-Assad.\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called Russia‚Äôs military intervention in Syria an unwelcome ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù that jeopardised peace efforts and risked clashes with western aircraft targeting Islamic State jihadists.\n‚ÄúThe recent Russian military attacks that go beyond Daesh (IS) and other UN-designated terrorist groups, as well as on the moderate opposition, are of deep concern and must cease immediately,‚Äù the EU‚Äôs 28 foreign ministers said in a statement.\n‚ÄúThis military escalation risks prolonging the conflict, undermining a political process, aggravating the humanitarian situation and increasing radicalisation,‚Äù they said.\nEU leaders meet Thursday for a summit likely to be dominated by the Syrian conflict which has claimed some 250,000 lives and driven about 12 million people ‚Äî half the population ‚Äî to flee their homes.\nMany of them have given up hope of an end to the war and have flooded into Europe seeking refuge, helping drive the worst migrant crisis since World War II.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday Russia‚Äôs military actions in Syria were meant to ‚Äústabilise the legitimate authorities and create conditions for finding a political compromise.‚Äù\nRussia, which insists its attacks on ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù include IS targets, has important military facilities in Syria and has backed Assad and his father before him against all rivals for decades.\nMeanwhile in Moscow, the defence ministry said its planes hit 53 targets in Syria over the past 24 hours as it steps up its bombing campaign.\nRussian jets conducted strikes in the provinces of Hama, Homs, Latakia and Idlib and destroyed ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù command posts, defensive positions, training camps and ammunition depots, the ministry said in a statement.\nIt said the bombing raids had severely disrupted supply chains for IS fighters.\nEU foreign ministers for their part urged Russia to ‚Äúfocus its efforts on the common objective of achieving a political solution to the conflict.‚Äù\nThey said this required ‚Äúa peaceful and inclusive transition‚Äù but it was not clear if Assad would have any role in it, reflecting sharp divisions over his immediate future.\nFor the longer term, ministers agreed he had no place in Syria.\n‚ÄúThere cannot be a lasting peace in Syria under the present leadership and until the legitimate grievances and aspirations of all components of the Syrian society are addressed,‚Äù they said.\n‚Äì Dangerous ‚Äògame-changer‚Äô ‚Äì\nMogherini warned earlier that Russian intervention in Syria was a dangerous and worrying ‚Äúgame-changer.‚Äù\nMogherini, a former Italian foreign minister once viewed as sympathetic to Moscow, said Russia must direct its attacks against IS, not the Western-backed rebel groups seeking Assad‚Äôs ouster.\nShe refused to be drawn on Assad‚Äôs future, stressing that the EU would back UN efforts to broker a peace deal.\n‚ÄúThis is a process which has to have all the relevant actors around the table,‚Äù she added.\nOne EU diplomat, who asked not to be named, said: ‚ÄúEveryone knows that you cannot build a transition without Assad.‚Äù\nBritish Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond appeared anxious to leave no wriggle room on that question after several of his fellow foreign ministers also suggested that Assad would inevitably be involved in any transition.\n‚ÄúEU foreign ministers ministers have just agreed a clear and united position against Assad, IS and recent Russian actions in Syria.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAssad bears greatest responsibility for 250,000 deaths/millions displaced.

 'Green Tea Caffeine Is A Personal Preference\nGreen tea is a best seller currently in the grocery stores, the convenience markets and at special events such as a baseball game. Green tea caffeine is a matter of personal preference because green tea can come with or without caffeine. Some people drink green tea because there is a wealth of information on the benefits of green tea.\nSome people make a conscious effort to drink green tea every day because of the reported benefits. Some of these people believe in the benefits, but they do not like to consume green tea caffeine for different reasons.\nSome people do not want to consume green tea caffeine because this substance can cause insomnia. Most people do not want anything to interfere with their sleep. Caffeine can be addictive, and those that suffer from an addiction to caffeine end up drinking or eating products with caffeine throughout the day. The foods with caffeine could include tea, coffee, and some sweets.\nOnce people learn of the benefits of green tea, they look for products with the green tea caffeine removed from the product. There are several companies that offer green tea without the caffeine so people can get the benefits without the unwanted side effects.\nGreen Tea Caffeine Is Similar To The Caffeine In Coffee\nGreen tea caffeine and coffee caffeine are similar substances that are naturally in the tea plants and the coffee beans. The amount of caffeine in tea and coffee can vary from one plant to the next and from one coffee bean to the next. In general, coffee has more caffeine than tea. Then there are products where the green tea caffeine or the coffee caffeine have been removed almost completely. Most people try different products, and buy the ones that meet with their approval.\nGreen tea caffeine is never completely removed from the tea leaves that are used to make the beverages offered in the stores. The green tea caffeine is almost completely removed from the products that are labeled as decaffeinated. The amount of the caffeine in tea seems to differ from leaf to leaf depending on the length of the tea leaf. People who have problems with caffeine can still drink green tea once the caffeine has been removed from the product.\nThe great benefits of decaffeinated green tea are similar to those of regular green tea. These benefits include better cardiovascular health and lower cholesterol. These benefits are important considerations when choosing a beverage.
