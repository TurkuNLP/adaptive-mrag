Exhibition will provide a meeting place for businesses interested in capitalizing on India's waste management and recycling markets.
Waste Management and Recycling India will be held from 8-10 April 2013 at India Expo Centre and Mart, Greater Noida Expressway, Delhi, India.
The conference is being organized by Inter Ads-Brooks Exhibitions of India in partnership with Mack Brooks Exhibitions Ltd. of the U.K.
The event is planned to provide a meeting place in India for businesses, products and services engaged in the waste and recycling industry, to connect the businesses involved in this sector and to assist professionals in discovering more about doing business in a country with one of the fastest growing economies, reports Michelle Amer, a spokesperson with Mack Brooks Exhibitions.
According to information posted on the conference website, India’s population produces some 68.8 million tons of municipal solid waste per year, a level of 188,500 tons per day. If the current growth trend continues, the organization has estimated, urban India will generate 160.5 million tons by 2041, and over the next decade some 920 million tonnes of solid waste will need to be properly managed.
Amer observes that with its current population of 1.2 billion people and a rapidly developing infrastructure, there are many opportunities in India for businesses in the recycling, waste management and energy from waste sectors. Amer also reports that by 2050, Indian economic output could be equivalent to that of the United States.
A number of U.S., European and U.K. companies are already working in India to take advantage of its waste infrastructure growth, Amer says.

TOPEKA, Kan. (2/26/08)--Kansas credit union supporters answered the last questions of a Senate subcommittee Friday in response to SB 535, a bill introduced by the Kansas Banking Association (KBA) that would change how credit unions are regulated and whom they can serve. The subcommittee will begin work on the bill Wednesday. The bill or a modified bill would then proceed to the full Senate Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee for consideration, said the Kansas Credit Union Association (KCUA). In a press release, KCUA said it could only speculate about the specific impacts the banker-backed bill will have on the state's credit union industry but added the bill is clearly directed at reducing consumer access to Kansas credit unions. "At this time, the process is in full swing, and we have placed our faith in the legislative process in Kansas," said Jerel Wright, assistant vice president of governmental and public affairs at KCUA. "We are asking that legislators make the right decision for credit unions and consumers in Kansas." If the bill were passed without revisions, it would fundamentally change the way Kansas credit unions have operated and been regulated over the past 80 years. It also would dramatically increase the regulatory burden placed on state-chartered credit unions by requiring extensive public notification and appeals processes for branching, merging and field of membership changes, said KCUA. "In effect, this bill would effectively eliminate the benefits of being a Kansas-chartered credit union because the bill adopts federal law regarding field of membership and state banking law for branching and mergers," said KCUA. "This is truly a consumer issue, and consumers should have the right to choose where they conduct their financial business," said Marla Marsh, president/CEO of KCUA. "When consumers are facing an economic and credit crisis, would we want to restrict or constrict access to a consumer-friendly alternative?" Marsh asked.

ID Theft Solutions
You've logged in, managed your finances, and can rest easy knowing you did it all on a secure site. Independent Bank of Texas takes aggressive steps to give you peace of mind that you are not mistakenly logging in to a bogus site and compromising your identity.
It's true that online banking has made managing our finances easier. However, it has also made customers and financial institutions susceptible to "phishing" schemes designed to con you into divulging sensitive financial information. With an estimated more than 11,900 phishing sites active, it has become a huge tool for identity-theft scammers.
That's why IBT is taking the next step in safeguarding your identity and financial information. IBT provides our customers with a next generation multilevel authentication process. This process is a password enhanced PC forensics solution that identifies each customer by their password and specific computer being used, and matches it with a secret unique image displayed on your login page. Not only is your identity proven to the IBT website, but our website also proves its identity to you.
IBT's Identity Theft Solution combines the traditional user name and password with the user computer's unique fingerprint resulting in an end-to-end protection against phishing, spoofing, keyboard logging, and other fraudulent attacks. Along with the increased protection, implementation is done without the need for new software. For customers with more than one PC, authentication confirmation is done through emailing a one-time password or by answering a unique question.
Next Generation Multilevel Authentication Process
1. USER VERIFICATION
Using secure cookies and Macromedia Flash shared objects, the user's computer is registered with a single device ID. IBT's ID Theft Solution examines a number of the user computer's characteristics to create a unique fingerprint that is checked each time the user logs in. With this security measure in place, criminals are unable to access account information even if they have the username and password.
2. WEBSITE VERIFICATION
In addition to the extra security measures taken on the user's end, IBT's website must prove its authentication to the user. This is done via a secret image chosen from more than 50,000 that is unique to each individual customer and is displayed on the login page. This visual security measure ensures that the user is on the correct website and not on a phishing or spoof site.
3. LOGIN VERIFICATION
Once the user's computer and company website are verified, the user then enters their username and password to complete the login process. If IBT's Identity Solution detects anything suspicious during the login process, the user is asked to verify their identity by answering a challenge question. If answered correctly, the unique image appears and they can then enter their password to complete the login.

Introduction to Online Jobs are investment free
Online jobs are the need of the day; especially an online job is a worth for students, senior citizens, disable peoples and housewives. Most of the people around the globe are interested in to earn some money for their living by working online. Online job are considered as the most comfortable one as by doing these jobs an employee is free of working hours as well as transportation and other requirements of an offline job.
Still there are many people who are reluctant to apply for an online job. They think that it is not possible to do such kind of job without an investment. They are not sure that even if they invest for it either the net result will be in their favor or they will end up as a loser.
To your great surprise I am giving you the good news that there is no investment required if you are interested in to work for an online job. The only thing what you have to do is to look for a legitimate website which is offering the legitimate jobs to its employees. To search for a legitimate website you should have lot of patience, should be hard working, and above all it needs your time and dedications. In this article I would like to discuss some of the basic strategies which could help you to search for a genuine employer.
What Tools are required for searching an online job?
Keyword is a basic tool to search for required information on the net, but without a proper combination of the keyword it is not possible to achieve the favorable results. For example if you are interested in to search for a site which is giving services for dating on line the best keyword will be “online dating”, “date online” or “online dating for singles”. There is lot of search engines including Google, and Yahoo where you could start your search. Including Google AdWords there are some other services which are providing help in searching for the proper keywords. These services provide you a lot of information about the proper keywords in one click.
There is no question that someone has to invest for an online job. These job are always free to all, there are hundreds of website which are directing you to such companies who are offering investment free online jobs. If any of the website or company ask you to pay before offering you a job than make it sure that it is scam.
As I say that there are a lot of companies available on the net which are offering for online jobs to the job seekers. These companies are giving the full details of the job they offer for, but if still you need to have some more additional information about a job to which you are interested in then do not hesitate to contact them and ask them for the required information.
Where to find an online job on the net
It is easy to search a job of your choice on the net but still you need some more information which could be helpful to you to come closer to your target. Forums are one of the best examples of it. Forums are one of the best places where you could search your required information more easily. Forums are like the houses of community where people come and sit together. On online forums people discuss and share their views and experiences. If you need a good advice or if you are in search of a legitimate online job site then forums are the best place for you. You can get an honest advice from an experience member as well as there are many other members who will willingly ready to lead you to a legitimate online job site.
It will be better for you to study the trends of the members of the concerned forum, see what most of them are talking about and what is interesting in it for you. Do most of the members discuss the same as what you are looking for? If the answer is in YES then you may start posting your posts and asking the other members for an online help. Ask them what you need, tell them about your experiences and qualifications. They will definitely be glad to help you. But if the answer is in a NO and the forum is not closer to your requirements then you should join some other one as net if full of the forums on different topics.
Members of the forum could give you the information about the website of different companies. These companies are providing complete details of each and every job they are offering for. Most of them provide a form where you could fill in all the required information they are asking for. But again before you fill in their online form you must be very careful and should check the worth of that site on the net. See that what page rank (PR) they are having on the net. There are lots of scam companies which also work in the same way as of a legitimate one and even they offer a better package as compare to a legitimate one.
Social networking is also a good source where you can search the job in the same way as what you are searching at the different online forums. Facebook, LinkedIn and google+ are some of the social networking site where thousands of people are available all-the time and are ready to help you.
End credits to Online Jobs are investment free
I hope that I already have discussed a lot about Online Jobs are investment free. I also hope that my readers will found this article very helpful for them. Any suggestions from my readers will be an honor for me.

Mediation is sometimes confused with relationship counselling - In actual fact mediation is not designed to explore whether it is possible or desirable to save the relationship. Mediation is instead designed to assist when there has been or will be a separation and both parties involved want to deal with the practicalities of that separation as amicably and productively as possible.
The key difference with mediation is that we would help both parties together, as opposed to one individual. This means that as mediators we are impartial and therefore cannot give either party legal advice but we can give a lot of legal information, using our skills as legal advisors.
Mediation can deal with the following:
- Arrangements for formalising the separation
- Living arrangements
- Financial arrangements
- Children arrangements
- Communication difficulties
If you are interested in mediation once you contact us we will need to contact your partner to invite them to mediation. If you are both willing to mediate, we shall firstly arrange initial meetings with you both individually, and then secondly, arrange the joint meetings to discuss the issues you want to address. You will set the agenda for mediation meetings so you will be able to give priority to the most important issues you are seeking to resolve.
Our mediators at Eric Robinson are Beverley Pym and Vicki Rawlins. Mediation can be conducted at any of our offices. Mediation costs are on a fixed fee basis.
If you are interested in mediation, please contact Beverley Pym on 01489 788922 or firstname.lastname@example.org.
If you want to discuss your options in greater detail, to help you decide which process to follow and which service you would like us to provide, we do offer an 30 minute options meeting, free of charge. Within this meeting we will not give you any legal advice on your family situation, but we will go through these options in greater detail, including cost and process information.
Please note that due to issues of impartiality, we will need to carry out conflict of interest checks for all of these alternative options. These checks will tell us if there is any reason due to confidential information held by Eric Robinson, we will not be able to assist you.
In addition, please note that if we give you any advice on your family law matter, we will then not be able to act for you as your mediators as we would no longer be impartial. Therefore if you are undecided as to which route to follow, we would recommend an options meeting so we are not prevented from acting as your mediators if you do decide that to be the route you wish to take.

Time management was vital in Premier Inn as well as any other company.

The Mishna on today’s daf focuses on the role of an arev – someone who agrees to guarantee a loan. According to the Mishna, although the arev agreed to be responsible for the loan, nevertheless the lender cannot collect from him without first trying to collect from the borrower. In a case where the lender states clearly at the time of the loan that he wants to collect from either one of them, then he has the right to do so. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagrees, ruling that in any case the lender must first collect from the borrower.
According to the conclusion of the Gemara, even the Tanna Kamma agrees that under ordinary circumstances when the borrower has the means to pay the loan, the lender cannot collect from the arev. The Gemara explains that the only disagreement between the Tanna Kamma and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is in the case of a kablan, that is, someone who says “give him a loan and I will pay you back.”
In explanation of the obligation of an arev to pay the loan in the event that the borrower cannot, Ameimar suggests that it is a case of asmakhta. As we learned above (daf 168 ), an asmakhta is a promise or agreement obligating the individual at some point in the future, should a specific event occur. As opposed to ordinary situations of a tenai – a standard agreement, that certainly takes effect – an asmakhta usually is an agreement based on the assumption that the condition will never actually take place. In our case we can assume that the arev anticipates that the borrower will pay the loan and that he does not really expect to pay.
According to this approach, whether or not an arev may actually have to pay should be dependent on the question of whether asmakhta kanya or not. Rav Ashi rejects this approach, arguing that we rule that an asmakhta does not create an obligation, yet people do co-sign loans. He concludes that in this case, the very fact that the arev is relied upon is sufficient to create the gemirut da’at – a conscious decision – necessary to overcome the doubts of the arev and to obligate him to pay.

Week from 10 to 16 June 2019
Stock indices continued to gain ground around the globe though investors remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting scheduled on 18-19 June. Optimism is fueled by the prospect of interest rate cuts this year but there is little expectation of a first move next week. Volatility eased again (CBOE VIX index down 6.26%) as the Trump administration stepped back from an immediate imposition of tariffs on Mexico and retail sales data in May showed a pick-up in consumer spending. Furthermore, Beijing decided to ease restrictions on local governments’ borrowing to boost infrastructure investment.
Asian markets took the lead (Shanghai Composite and Nikkei up 1.92% and 1.11% respectively) despite massive and historic street protests in Hong-Kong against a proposed extradition bill that has stoked fears of expanding control from China. Wall Street’s major indices edged up (S&P500: +0.47%, DJIA: +0.41%, Nasdaq: +0.70%) and the same was true for Europe, though to a lesser extent (MSCI EMU: +0.14%, FTSE100: +0.19%).
Most sectors finished the week into positive territory. Consumer discretionary was the best performer (+2.44%) followed by utilities (+1.18% – once again defensive sectors fared well), communication services (+1.12%) and information technology (+1.07%).
Going against the trend, industrials (-0.43%) and energy (-0.51%) lagged the market. In this regard, it is worth noting that oil prices fell to five-month lows (WTI down -2.74% at $52.51 a barrel) despite their end-of-week rebound after suspected attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. All the evidence suggests that high U.S. crude inventories and a bleak demand outlook are dragging down prices.
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield was unchanged at 2.09% like the German Bund at -0.26%. The 3-month U.S. T-bill dipped slightly from 2.28% to 2.20%, its lowest level since September 2018. Emerging debt and high-yield bonds moved up 0.94% and 0.24% (in the U.S.) respectively.
Lastly, gold was still near 14-month highs at around $1,340/oz.

BEIJING — Asian stocks gained Monday amid investor jitters the U.S.-China trade war might be worsening.
Benchmarks in Shanghai and South Korea rose while Hong Kong and Australia were unchanged. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.
Investors were encouraged by hopes global central banks will keep interest rates low to shore up economic growth. But they worry President Donald Trump’s impending Sept. 1 tariff hike on more Chinese imports will scuttle talks aimed at ending their trade war.
Wall Street’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index dropped as much as 1.3% Friday after Trump said it would be “fine” if trade talks next month don’t happen.”
Safe havens are “still in demand on trade war anxiety,” said Alfonso Esparza of Oanda in a report. “Headwinds remain strong as a deal in the short term between the U.S. and China is a long shot.”
The Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.7% to 2,793.67 points while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was little-changed at 25,937.44.
Seoul’s Kospi added 0.5% to 1,947.05 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 was flat at 6,582.60. Markets in Taiwan and New Zealand declined. Exchanges in Singapore and Thailand were closed for holidays.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended down 0.7% on Friday at 2,918.65. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% to 26,287.44 and the Nasdaq lost 1% to 7,959.14.
ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 18 cents per barrel to $54.33 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.94 on Friday to close at $54.40. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 13 cents to $58.40 per barrel in London. It gained $1.15 the previous session to $58.53.
CURRENCY: The dollar edged down to 105.47 yen from Friday’s 105.66 yen. The euro gained to $1.1208 from $1.1201.
