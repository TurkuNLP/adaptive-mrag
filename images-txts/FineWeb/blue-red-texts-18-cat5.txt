There won't be many players as excited as Jelena Skerovic when next year's EuroBasket Women tips off.
Skerovic will wear the Montenegro shirt when the tournament is held in Poland.
Her national team qualified for the event for the first time in their history last summer.
"It's a huge success for my career," Skerovic said to Basketball World News.
"With the national team, we have a chance to show our game and our possibilities in the European Championship.
"In three years, we've gone from the B division to the A division and showed we can play basketball.
"I think we're going to be good.
"People are going to start looking at us.
"It makes me very proud, to be Montenegrin and to be a part of the national team."
Skerovic, a 1.77m guard, turns 30 two days before Christmas.
She is right now competing for Frisco Sika Brno in the Czech top flight and the EuroLeague Women.
Brno will take on Gorzow in Poland this week in Europe's elite club competition.

Our Three Stooges
In honor of the new Three Stooges movie coming out on DVD today, we decided to examine this season through the eyes of the the ‘Riders version of Moe, Larry, and Curly also known as Mike Olt, Leury Garcia, and Jake Brigham.
Mike Olt’s initials are MO making him Moe. When asked about the season is going, he said he thinks it’s going well.
“I’m happy I was able to make improvements in the off-season and build on those improvements,” Olt said. “I put them into practice and keep working hard.”
Olt is currently hitting .289 with 22 home runs and 63 RBIs. On July 5, Baseball America listed Olt as the third in the top 30 prospects in the Rangers organization and 11th in all of minor league baseball.
Leury Garcia’s first name is pronounced like Larry making him Larry. Garcia said he thinks everything is going good so far this season and he wouldn’t change anything that he’s been doing.
Garcia is currently hitting .273 with 8 triples and 18 stolen bases. Baseball America listed Garcia as the 11th in the top 30 prospects in the Rangers organization.
Jake Brigham started out the season with thick, curly black hair but shaved it off making him our Curly.
Like Olt, Brigham said he thinks the season is going well for him and that he’s learning a lot.
“I’m staying healthy and getting to pitch a lot of innings,” Brigham said. “I try to learn something every time I go out there.”
Brigham currently has a record of four wins and five losses with a 4.67 ERA. He has also struck out 99 batters so far this season.

When the bullpen doors at Yankee Stadium fly open, it begins. The crowd roars and rises to its feet. And its not just the sight of a slender Panamanian relief pitcher lightly trotting toward the mound that thrills the pinstriped throng. It's the explosion of Metallica's "Enter Sandman" from the speakers. With the song reverberating throughout this corner of the Bronx, it seems inexplicable that any opposing hitter could muster the courage to get a hit. Of course, that cutter helps.
The Philadelphia Eagles have "Fly Eagles Fly." The Baltimore Orioles have "Oriole Magic." Nearly every sports team has an anthem Some of these stadium songs have been played years while others are fad tunes that fans latched onto during a particularly memorable season.
Whether you're sick of it or not, it's hard to deny that oft-repeated songs like "Kernkraft 400" by Zombie Nation pumps up the crowd after someone throws down a monster dunk. But before the players create those memorable moments, they're getting amped up by whatever they've got pulsing through their own headphones. When they take to their stage -- be it court, pitch, gridiron or diamond -- they may then be serenaded by fans belting out a rendition of "Seven Nation Army." Music has its role before, during and, most certainly, after any game. After all, when a team wins the whole thing, you can bet "We Are The Champions" by Queen gets played.
Sports can also inspire music but we'll save that for another playlist. Here are a group of songs that you'll likely recognize from a stadium near you.

- This event has passed.
April 14 @ 7:00 am - 10:30 am
This Legacy Duathlon starts back in North Salt Lake. This race is a multisport race like a triathlon without a swim portion. Triathletes love the race in that it allows them to test out their bikes and legs this early season as well as first-time triathletes who love to do a race without the swim. Fast, Flat and straight.
